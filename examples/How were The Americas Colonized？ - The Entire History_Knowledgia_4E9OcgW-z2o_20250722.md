欧洲人为什么要殖民美洲？
是什么驱使欧洲列强跨越浩瀚的海洋，开疆拓土，相互竞争，最终几乎占领了整个欧洲大陆？
为什么每个帝国都专注于某些特定地区？
为什么这么少的人就能如此迅速地获得如此多的东西？
要了解从第一艘西班牙船只登陆加勒比海到 18 世纪末美洲殖民化的完整故事，我们必须追溯到最初。

Why did the Europeans colonize the Americas?
What drove Europe's powers to cross a vast ocean, carve out new territories, and compete until nearly the entire continent was claimed?
Why did each empire focus on certain regions?
And how did so few take so much so fast?
To understand the entire story of the colonization of the Americas from the first Spanish ship landing in the Caribbeans to the late 18th century, we have to go back to the very beginning.

# How the exploration started
00:00:37 - 00:02:20

15 世纪末，一位雄心勃勃的航海家向葡萄牙国王热情地提议，要向西方寻找​​新的土地和财富。
他的提议被认为过于异想天开且成本过高而被驳回。
这位名叫克里斯托弗·哥伦布的意志坚定的水手并没有气馁，而是抱着试试看的态度去西班牙碰碰运气。
那是1492年，他的时机把握得再好不过了。
西班牙人刚刚击退了最后一批令人畏惧的穆斯林占领军，现在渴望以自己的名义扩张领土。
西班牙国库充裕，而且欣赏哥伦布的自信。
1492年8月，哥伦布扬帆横渡大西洋。
仅仅两个月后，他就抵达巴哈马群岛，实现了欧洲人与美洲的首次重大接触。
世界即将发生翻天覆地的变化。
克里斯托弗·哥伦布发现美洲标志着欧洲对美洲土地殖民的开始。
它催生了新的国家，并使一些欧洲强国变得极其富有。
这场灾难也给当地居民带来了毁灭性的打击，他们从此一蹶不振。
这一切的起因，原本是寻找通往远东（或称印度，即东方）的另一条航道。
是什么促成了欧洲扩张的这股巨大浪潮？
那么，美洲的前一百年过得如何呢？

In the late 15th century, an ambitious sailor approached the king of Portugal with an impassioned offer to find new lands and riches to the west.
His proposal was dismissed as being far too fanciful and way too costly.
Undeterred, this determined sailor, a man by the name of Christopher Columbus, tried his luck with Spain.
It was 1492, and his timing couldn't have been better.
The Spanish had just seen off the last of the daunting occupying Muslim forces and were now keen to expand in their own name.
There was money in the coffers, and Spain liked Columbus' confidence.
Columbus set sail across the Atlantic in August 1492.
Just 2 months later, he landed in the Bahamas, making the first significant European contact with the Americas.
The world was about to change forever.
Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas signaled the start of the European colonization of the American lands.
It gave birth to new nations and made some European powers incredibly rich.
It also took a devastating toll on the native populations from which they never recovered.
All of this from what was intended to be a search for another passage to the Far East or the Indies as the East was simply known.
What led to this huge push for European expansion?
And how were the first 100 years in the Americas?

# 1492
00:02:20 - 00:04:56

首先，了解欧洲列强为何被迫寻求通往西方的路线很有帮助。
几个世纪以来，欧洲一直依赖丝绸之路与东方进行贸易。
丝绸之路促进了欧洲国家、印度和中国之间的贸易往来。
从茶叶、丝绸、香料、棉花、象牙到贵金属，各种商品都曾进行过贸易，直到奥斯曼帝国制止了这一切。
1453 年，奥斯曼帝国占领了君士坦丁堡（今伊斯坦布尔），这意味着他们实际上控制了丝绸之路的西端。
这意味着沿这条著名路线进行贸易的任何商品都将大幅增税，这或多或少迫使欧洲寻找通往东方的替代路线。
当时，葡萄牙人在海上航行方面处于世界领先地位，他们喜欢派遣船只绕过非洲进入印度洋。
他们的计划原本就是这样，直到一个名叫克里斯托弗·哥伦布的人踏上了巴哈马群岛的海滩。
突然，出现了另一种选择。
1493年，哥伦布第二次航行到美洲，但这一次他的目的性更强。
哥伦布第一次航行时只带了三艘船。
第二次出征时，舰队由 17 艘船组成，其中包括殖民者、牧师和士兵。
他们甚至带了一群看起来很凶猛的獒犬来进一步恐吓当地居民。
哥伦布似乎并不特别担心当地土著的抵抗。
然而，在哥伦布 1492 年的日记中，有一段颇具启发性的摘录，他写道，加勒比海地区的人民应该乐于做仆人，很容易就能皈依基督教。
他还注意到，当地居民似乎没有武器，或者至少不熟悉剑之类的铁制武器。
这对西班牙的统治者来说是一个极大的鼓舞，于是在 1493 年，哥伦布再次被派往建立殖民地。
圣多明各成为美洲第一个正式的欧洲定居点，创造了历史。
该殖民地建立在加勒比海的伊斯帕尼奥拉岛上，如今该岛分属海地和多米尼加共和国。

To begin, it helps to understand why the European powers were compelled to seek routes to the west.
For centuries, Europe had been dependent on the Silk Road for trade with the East.
The Silk Road enabled trade between European countries, India, and China.
Everything from tea, silk, spices, cotton, ivory, and precious metals were traded until the Ottoman Empire put a stop to it all.
When the Ottomans claimed Constantinople in 1453, today's Istanbul, it meant they effectively controlled the western end of the Silk Road.
This meant big tax hikes on anything that was traded along the famous route, and this more or less forced Europe to look for alternate routes to the east.
At the time, the Portuguese were world leaders in sea navigation and favored sending ships around Africa into the Indian Ocean.
This was their plan until a fellow named Christopher Columbus walked onto a beach in the Bahamas archipelago.
Suddenly, there was another option.
In 1493, Columbus made his second voyage to the Americas, but this time it was far more purposeful.
On his first voyage, Columbus had set out with just three ships.
The second time around comprised a fleet of 17 ships, which included colonists, priests, and soldiers.
They even took a pack of fearsome looking mastiff dogs to further intimidate the natives.
Not that Columbus was particularly concerned about any native resistance.
However, in a revealing extract from his 1492 diary, Columbus wrote that the Caribbean people should be good servants and would easily be made into Christians.
He also noted that the natives seemed to be unarmed or were at least unfamiliar with iron weapons such as swords.
This was immensely encouraging to the powers back in Spain and Columbus was sent again in 1493 to set up a colony.
History was made when Sto Domingo became the first official European settlement in the Americas.
The colony was established on the Caribbean island of Hispanola, which is today split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

# Treaty of Tordesillas
00:04:56 - 00:07:03

当消息传回欧洲，得知西部有一大片土地时，葡萄牙人也想分一杯羹。
当然，西班牙非常清楚葡萄牙的海军实力，也意识到葡萄牙可能会成为其在新世界进一步扩张的真正障碍。
因此，在 1494 年，教皇亚历山大五世六世介入以避免未来的冲突。
在大西洋上划定了一条南北走向的分界线。
这条线以西的土地归西班牙所有，以东的领土则归葡萄牙所有。
两国同意并签署了《托里西拉斯条约》。
分界线大致位于大西洋中部，距西非海岸的佛得角群岛以西约 2000 公里。
总体思路是，哥伦布发现的新土地归西班牙所有，而葡萄牙则可以自由地征服非洲和南亚。
除了少数例外，这片区域几乎完全是西班牙的领土。
南美洲一大片土地伸入了葡萄牙一侧的分界线。
1500年时，葡萄牙人对此一无所知。
[音乐]1498 年，瓦斯科·达马成功绕过非洲到达印度，成为第一个通过海路到达印度的欧洲人。
葡萄牙人感到兴奋，因为经由地中海进入印度的通道被意大利和奥斯曼帝国的舰队封锁了。
第二次航行随即展开，这次由佩德罗·阿尔瓦雷斯·卡布拉尔负责。
卡布拉尔指挥着 13 艘船，船上载有 1000 多名士兵和补给品。
和达玛一样，他沿着非洲西海岸航行，然后驶入西大西洋，借助信风的力量前进。

When word filtered back to Europe that there was a mass of land to the west, the Portuguese wanted in on the action.
Spain, of course, was only too aware of Portugal's naval strength and realized the Portuguese could prove a real obstacle to further expansion in the new world.
And so, in 1494, Pope Alexander V 6th stepped in to avoid future conflicts.
A demarcation line was drawn up in the Atlantic Ocean running north to south.
Anything lying to the west of the line was to be Spain's and any territory to the east were fair game for Portugal.
Both countries agreed and signed the treaty of Torisilas.
The demarcation line was situated roughly in the middle of the Atlantic, about 2,000 km west of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa.
The general idea was that the new lands discovered by Columbus would go to Spain, while Portugal was free to conquer Africa and southern Asia.
There was just a small exception to what was pretty much all Spanish territory.
A sizable chunk of land in South America was jutting out into Portugal's side of the demarcation line.
In 1500, this was unknown to the Portuguese.
[Music] In 1498, Vasco Dama had successfully rounded Africa to reach India, becoming the first European to reach India by sea.
Portugal was excited because access to India via the Mediterranean was blocked by Italian and Ottoman fleets.
A second voyage was organized, this time with Pedro Alvarez Cabral in charge.
Cabral commanded 13 ships which held over 1,000 men and supplies.
Like Dama, he sailed down the African West Coast and then headed out into the western Atlantic to ride on the back of the trade winds.
Unlike Dama, though, Cabral continued heading west.

00:07:03 - 00:10:46

但与达马不同的是，卡布拉尔继续向西行进。
1500 年 4 月，他登陆巴西东北海岸的巴希亚。
卡布拉尔意识到这片新土地位于分界线的葡萄牙一侧，于是代表葡萄牙王室宣布对其拥有主权。
尽管许多历史学家推测，在卡布拉尔之前，其他欧洲人很可能已经到过那里，但人们普遍认为他是正式发现巴西的人。
卡布拉尔环顾巴吉亚四周，猜测这里实际上是某个大陆的一部分。
他立即派船返回里斯本，将这个好消息传达出去。
葡萄牙人渴望得到巴西可能蕴藏的任何贵金属。
具体来说，就是黄金和白银。
当葡萄牙人意识到当地木材是唯一真正有价值的资源时，他们在接下来的几十年里对巴西失去了兴趣。
人们发现当地一种名为巴西木的树木很有用，因为可以从中提取红色染料。
这种材料过去在欧洲被用来制作纺织品和衣服。
葡萄牙人让当地人为他们清理森林。
为了达成交易，他们与当地土著交换了镜子、剪刀、刀、斧等物品。
从一开始，葡萄牙人与土著居民的关系就与西班牙人与墨西哥和中美洲土著居民的关系截然不同。
虽然西班牙的殖民统治更多地基于彻底的征服，但并没有证据表明巴西拥有丰富的自然资源。
葡萄牙最初并没有定居这片新领土，而是决定将其作为欧洲和印度之间的贸易基地。
但最终，人们认为管理巴西的最佳方法是建立殖民地。
1532 年，葡萄牙在圣维森特（位于今天的圣保罗附近）建立了第一个定居点。
新获得的土地被划分为 15 个县，这些县是授予人们用于农业生产的土地区域。
船长职位的拥有者是贵族、商人或退役水手。
很快人们就发现，糖是当时最值得种植的作物。
事情开始缓慢但朝着正确的方向发展。
1549年，巴西被宣布为英国的正式殖民地。
港口殖民地萨尔瓦多·德巴哈吉亚发展成为首府，拥有大教堂、医院、监狱和海关大楼。
与此同时，西班牙开始了对中美洲和南美洲的快速殖民时期。
在伊斯帕尼奥拉岛定居之后，西班牙人于1508 年殖民了波多黎各，1509 年殖民了牙买加，1511 年殖民了古巴。
1513 年，瓦斯科·德·巴尔博亚穿越巴拿马群岛，成为第一个正式看到太平洋的欧洲人，并宣布太平洋为西班牙领土。
1519年，西班牙的发展真正腾飞。
埃尔南德·科尔特斯是一位驻扎在古巴的探险家，他渴望为王室发现新的土地和宝藏。
和其他人一样，他也听说了墨西哥大陆上蕴藏着等待被发现的金银矿藏的传闻。

And in April 1500, he landed on the northeastern shores of Brazil at Bajia.
Realizing that this new land lay on Portugal's side of the demarcation line, Cabral claimed it on behalf of the crown.
Although many historians have speculated that other Europeans had most likely been there before Cabral, he is generally acknowledged to be the one who officially discovered Brazil.
Cabral looked around Bajia and guessed that it was in fact part of a continent.
He sent a ship back to Lisbon immediately to spread the good news.
The Portuguese were eager to get their hands on any precious metals that might have been in Brazil.
specifically gold and silver.
When it became clear that the local timber was the only real resource of any value, the Portuguese lost interest in Brazil for the next few decades.
The local trees called Brazilwood were found to be useful because of the red dye that could be extracted.
This was used to make textiles and clothes back in Europe.
And the Portuguese had the natives clear the forests for them.
They traded items such as mirrors, scissors, knives, and axes with the natives to seal the deal.
Almost from the start, the Portuguese relationship with the indigenous people was markedly different from that between the Spanish and the natives in Mexico and Central America.
While the Spanish colonization was based more on out-and-out conquest, there was no evidence of natural riches in Brazil.
Instead of settling the new territory, Portugal initially decided to keep it as a trading base between Europe and India.
Eventually though, it was decided that the best way to manage Brazil was by forming a colony.
And in 1532, the first Portuguese settlement was established in Sao Vicente on the mid coast near today's Sao Paulo.
The new land was divided up into 15 captaincies which were areas of land granted to people for agriculture.
The captaincy owners were nobles, merchants or ex-sailors.
And it was soon evident that sugar was the go-to crop to grow.
Things began to move slowly but in the right direction.
And in 1549, Brazil was declared an official crown colony.
The port colony Salvador Debahajia became the capital complete with a cathedral, hospital, prison, and a customs house.
In the meantime, Spain had launched into a period of rapid colonization in Central and South America.
Following on from settling in Hispanola, the Spanish then colonized Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica in 1509, and then Cuba in 1511.
In 1513, Vasco de Balboa became the first European to officially set sight on the Pacific Ocean when he crossed the ismas of Panama and declared the Pacific as a Spanish territory.
And then in 1519, things really took off for Spain.
Hernand Cortez was an explorer stationed in Cuba and eager to discover new lands and treasures for the crown.
Like others, he'd heard the rumors of the gold and silver that was waiting to be discovered over on the mainland, Mexico.

于 1519 年 2 月登陆尤卡坦半岛海岸。
科尔特斯接触到的第一批土著居民是玛雅部落。
但他很快意识到，为了完全控制墨西哥，他必须战胜强大的阿兹特克人。
阿兹特克人是当时该地区最先进的文明，他们的首都是特诺蒂特兰，后来发展成为墨西哥城。
然而，西班牙人对自己的胜算很有信心。
他们拥有强大的火力，包括钢剑和火枪，以及组织良好的军队，配备有马匹和猎犬。
西班牙人还拥有欧洲人对抗土著军队最致命的武器——疾病。
尤其是斯莫洛克斯，他是一个大规模杀人犯。
美洲的土著部落都没有接触过这种疾病，因此没有任何免疫力。
天花很快就给阿兹特克人带来了沉重的打击，凭借着更先进的武器，西班牙人在 1521 年占领了泰特兰。
然而，阿兹特克人并没有束手就擒，他们战斗到了最后一刻。
但他们伤亡惨重，最终被疾病和西班牙的炮火击溃。
据估计，阿兹特克人在战斗中损失了超过24 万名士兵，其中一半以上死于疾病。
在接下来的几年里，墨西哥的大部分地区沦陷，西班牙人随后将目光转向更南方的印加帝国控制的秘鲁地区。

landing on the shores of Yucatan in February 1519.
The first indigenous people Cortez interacted with were from the Mayan tribes.
But he soon realized that in order to gain full control of Mexico, he had to overpower these mighty Aztecs.
The Aztecs were the most advanced civilization in the region at the time and were based out of their capital, Tenno Titlan, which would later become Mexico City.
However, the Spanish liked their chances.
They had superior firepower with steel swords and guns, plus well-organized armies with horses and dogs.
The Spanish also had arguably the European's deadliest weapon against native forces, diseases.
Smallox, in particular, was a mass killer.
None of the native tribes in the Americas had been exposed to the disease and had zero immunity.
It didn't take long for smallpox to exact a crushing toll on the Aztecs and aided by their superior weapons, the Spanish took control of Tennos Titlan in 1521.
The Aztecs hadn't gone down without a fight, however, and had battled fiercely to the end.
But they were simply too decimated and ultimately overwhelmed by sickness and Spain's artillery.
It was estimated that the Aztecs lost over 240,000 soldiers during the fighting with more than half that number falling to disease.
Most of Mexico would fall over the next few years and the Spanish then set their sights further south to the Inca controlled regions of Peru.

# Conquest of the Inca
00:12:29 - 00:14:04

这绝非易事。
1528年，印加帝国正处于鼎盛时期。
其领土面积达180万平方公里。
1532年，弗朗西斯科·皮萨罗率领西班牙军队进入秘鲁，与印加军队发生冲突，争夺秘鲁及其周边地区的控制权。
尽管人数处于绝对劣势，皮萨罗和他的军队还是充分利用了他们强大的火力，屠杀了数千名印加人，印加人对欧洲入侵者的枪炮和刀剑毫无还手之力。
印加领导人之间爆发内战，导致印加军队组织混乱，毫无准备，这进一步帮助了西班牙人取得胜利。
阿塔瓦尔帕皇帝战败，西班牙不仅占领了秘鲁，还占领了周边所有印加领土。
这几乎包括了整个南美洲，除了葡萄牙控制的巴西和委内瑞拉。
西班牙早在 1516 年就已进入阿根廷，但由于资源匮乏而感到失望，直到 1580 年才正式在那里定居。
1537 年，西班牙军队进军哥伦比亚并占领了智利。
1841年，西班牙也开始进军北美。
1559 年，特里斯坦·杜纳·E·阿里拉诺 (Tristan Duna E. Arilano)在今天的佛罗里达州彭萨科拉建立了一个定居点。

This was no easy feat.
In 1528, the Inca Empire was at the height of its powers.
Its territory covered a gigantic 1,800,000 square kilometers.
In 1532, Francisco Pizarro led Spanish forces into Peru, where they clashed with the Inca army in a fight to control Peru and its surrounding territories.
Despite being vastly outnumbered, Pizarro and his troops took full advantage of their superior firepower had massacred thousands of Incas who had no reply to the guns and swords of the European invaders.
The Spanish were further aided by the aftermath of a civil war that had erupted amongst the Inca leaders, leaving the Incan armies disorganized and unprepared for the onslaught.
Emperor Atawalpa was defeated and Spain had captured not just Peru but all of the Incan territories surrounding it.
This included almost all of South America with the exception of the Portuguesecontrolled Brazil and Venezuela.
Spain had been in Argentina in 1516 but was underwhelmed by the lack of resources and didn't officially settle there until 1580.
In 1537, Spanish troops marched into Colombia and took over Chile.
In 1841, Spain additionally began making inroads into North America.
In 1559, Tristan Duna E.

1565年，西班牙人在佛罗里达州圣奥古斯丁建立了一个殖民地，距离今天的杰克逊维尔不远。
整个16 世纪，西班牙人逐渐迁入后来成为美国南部地区的区域。
这其中包括德克萨斯州、新墨西哥州、科罗拉多州、加利福尼亚州和亚利桑那州，这意味着西班牙已经获得了横跨两大洲的大片土地。
英国和法国都注意到了这一切。
这两个欧洲超级大国也知道西班牙和葡萄牙签订的《托尔托伊西利乌斯条约》，并决定完全无视它。
毕竟，这两个国家都不听命于教皇，而且都坚信自己完全有权在新世界攫取自己所能获得的一切。
法国是第一个认真开展搜寻活动的国家。

Arilano established a settlement in today's Pensacola in Florida.
Then in 1565, the Spanish set up a colony in St.
Augustine, Florida, not far from modern-day Jacksonville.
Throughout the 16th century, the Spanish gradually moved into areas of what would become the southern United States.
This included Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and Arizona, meaning that Spain had secured huge expanses of land across two continents.
None of this activity had escaped the attention of Britain and France.
The two European superpowers also knew about Spain and Portugal's Treaty of Tortoisilius and decided to completely disregard it.
After all, neither nation answered to the Pope and both firmly believed that they had every right to acquire what they could in the new world.
France was the first to set up a serious quest.
In 1534, Francis I sent Jacques Cartier across the Atlantic on the first of his three voyages to North America.

# French Arrival in Canada
00:15:13 - 00:16:55

开始了其三次前往北美的航行中的第一次。
卡地亚探索了纽芬兰的海岸线，并沿着圣劳伦斯河旅行。
1534年7月，法国成为第三个正式登陆美洲的欧洲国家。
卡蒂埃在魁北克省加斯半岛的海岸登陆，并在沙滩上竖起十字架，宣布这片土地归法国王室所有。
建立新法兰西的尝试注定是短暂的。
卡蒂埃也曾于 1541 年尝试在后来成为魁北克城的地方建立殖民地，但由于土著部落的敌对行动和恶劣的天气，该计划失败了。
随后，法国人试图在北美海岸更南端的地区建立殖民地，1562 年在南卡罗来纳州的帕里斯岛，1564 年在今天的佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔。
但这些努力都因西班牙人的袭击而受挫，西班牙人对法国即将殖民北美越来越感到疑神疑鬼。
1598 年，法国曾尝试在加拿大新斯科舍省附近的塞布尔岛上建立一个流放犯人的殖民地，但最终未能实现。
法国早期的尝试资金不足，没有获得成功建立殖民地所需的足够支持。
再加上与当地部落的不断战斗和恶劣的天气，到16 世纪末，法国的努力几乎没有得到任何成果。

Cartier explored the coast of New Foundland and traveled along the St.
Lawrence River.
In July of 1534, France became the third European country to officially land in the Americas.
Cartier landed on the shores of the Gas Peninsula in Quebec and placed a cross in the sand, claiming the land for the French crown.
It was to be a short-lived attempt to build New France.
Cartier also tried to establish a colony in what would become Quebec City in 1541, but the project failed due to hostilities from native tribes and atrocious weather.
The French then attempted to start colonies further down the North American coast at Paris Island in South Carolina in 1562 and then in present-day Jacksonville, Florida in 1564.
These efforts were thwarted by Spanish attacks who had grown increasingly paranoid about the impending French colonization of North America.
France made a half-hearted attempt to start a colony of convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598, but nothing materialized.
The early attempts by the French were poorly financed and didn't receive anywhere near the amount of support needed to successfully establish colonies.
That added to constant fighting with the local tribes and harsh weather meant France had little to show for its efforts by the end of the 16th century.
Big changes were taking place in England, contrarily, and it too was about to throw its hat into the ring.

# English Arrival in North America
00:16:55 - 00:18:37

它也即将加入这场竞争。
英国当时已经拥有一支强大而成熟的海军，并希望积累大量的财富。
1558年伊丽莎白女王登基时，她已经做好了采取行动的准备。
伊丽莎白不仅允许英国船只袭击和掠夺从美洲返回的西班牙船只，而且还资助了前往加勒比海的航行。
由于西班牙的强烈报复，这些冒险行动都以失败告终。
于是，伊丽莎白和英国将目光转向了北美海岸。
1584 年，冒险家沃尔特·雷利获得了探索北美的特许状。
授予雷利这项特许状的动机既有经济方面的，也有意识形态方面的。
伊丽莎白意识到殖民北美部分地区的巨大潜力，并且热衷于对抗该地区的西班牙天主教。
1585年，罗利组织了一支探险队，前往北卡罗来纳州附近的罗瓦诺克岛定居。
罗瓦诺克殖民地从一开始就举步维艰，两年后，当一艘补给船从英国返回时，该定居点已被废弃。
罗瓦诺克之谜至今仍困扰着历史学家。
有人认为殖民者融入了当地土著居民之中。
另一些人则认为这些定居者只是灭亡了。
然而，英国并没有气馁，而是开始计划再次远征美国东海岸。

England already had a strong and established navy and was looking to build some serious wealth.
When Queen Elizabeth took the throne in 1558, she was ready for action.
Elizabeth not only gave the green light for British ships to attack and loot any Spanish ships traveling back from the Americas with booty, but she also sponsored voyages to the Caribbean.
When these ventures failed because of strong reprisals from the Spanish, Elizabeth and Britain then focused their sights on the North American coast.
The adventurous swashbuckler Walter Raleigh was given a charter to explore North America in 1584.
The motives for giving Raleigh the go-ahad were both economical and ideological.
Elizabeth realized the enormous potential that lay in colonizing parts of North America and was also keen to counter Spanish Catholicism in the region.
In 1585, Raleigh set up an expedition to settle at Rowanoke Island off North Carolina.
The Rowanoke colony struggled from the outset, and when a supply ship returned from England after 2 years, the settlement had been abandoned.
The mystery of Rowanoke still puzzles historians today.
Some believe the colonists joined the local natives.
Others believe the settlers simply perished.
However, Britain was far from discouraged and began making plans for another expedition to the American East Coast.
Throughout the early years of European colonization, the interaction with native populations varied widely.

# Treatment of Natives and Religion
00:18:37 - 00:22:43

在欧洲殖民统治的早期，与当地居民的互动方式多种多样。
有些定居者之间建立了相对友好的关系，而另一些定居者之间的关系从一开始就十分紧张。
总的来说，欧洲人认为自己是优等种族，他们的角色是教化和教育土著居民。
西班牙人在加勒比海的伊斯帕尼奥拉岛定居后，很快就奴役了当地居民。
他们进入墨西哥后也沿用了这种做法。
战俘中的土著居民很快就被强迫劳动，而疾病也开始肆虐当地人口。
西班牙人将目光投向了西非。
英国人也持类似观点。
他们到那里是为了殖民和掠夺他们所需的一切。
如果当地人不喜欢，那是他们的问题。
这导致殖民初期暴力事件频发。
虽然法国人后来证明了与当地居民交好的好处，但英国人、西班牙人和葡萄牙人主要关注的是征服。
这意味着殖民者和土著居民之间的交流往往十分残酷。
殖民者在武器方面拥有技术优势，而土著居民则在利用他们非常熟悉的环境方面具有优势。
宗教在南美洲和北美洲也发挥了另一个重要作用。
人们期望当地居民皈依基督教，并派遣传教士去感化土著居民。
许多欧洲人并没有意识到，当地土著居民可能拥有自己的文化和宗教信仰。
有些西班牙传教士能够比其他人花更多的时间与当地居民相处，并开始同情他们，理解他们的事业。
教皇保罗三世阅读了传教士的信件，并警告殖民者，土著居民不是应该被杀害或奴役的牲畜，而是有灵魂、能够获得救赎的人。
在当时，这是一种相当开明的观点。
虽然教皇承认基督教是唯一真正的出路，但他表示殖民者至少应该关注土著居民的困境。
即便如此，单是身体上的冲击也一定非常巨大。
双方都从未见过像对方这样的事物，第一次接触引发了各种各样的情绪，从轻微的好奇到嘲笑和恐惧。
一些定居者意识到，与当地土著居民交朋友会对他们有利。
当地人比他们更了解这片土地，他们可以学习如何耕种和狩猎。
1585 年，英国人最初在罗瓦诺克定居时，就与当地的阿尔冈昆人建立了联系。
阿尔冈昆人教他们如何耕种土地以及在哪里寻找食物。
这种关系如此之好，以至于许多人认为，生活困顿的定居者可能只是选择与阿朗昆人一起生活。
撇开其他因素不谈，无论欧洲列强的殖民地以何种产业为基础，它们都需要劳动力。
当殖民者发现这项工作过于繁重，而且疾病导致被奴役的土著居民大量死亡后，殖民者开始从西非运来奴隶。
因此，在美洲殖民统治的最初100年后，西班牙在获得的领土和财富方面显然是最大的赢家。
西班牙人从布宜诺斯艾利斯一直到佛罗里达和德克萨斯都建立了殖民地。
然而，法国即将产生巨大的影响力，而英国才刚刚起步。
至少在北美，巨大的变革即将到来。

Some settlers were able to establish relatively friendly relationships while other situations were heated from the start.
On the whole, the Europeans assumed themselves to be the superior race, and their role was to civilize and educate the natives.
The Spanish were quick to enslave the local population when they settled in Hispanola in the Caribbean.
They continued this practice when they ventured into Mexico.
Natives captured in battle were soon put to work and when disease began to take its toll on the local populations.
The Spanish looked to West Africa.
The British had a similar viewpoint.
They were there to colonize and take what they needed.
If the natives didn't like it, that was their problem.
This led to regular outbreaks of violence in the early days of colonization.
While the French later demonstrated the benefits of befriending local populations, the British, Spanish, and Portuguese were primarily concerned with conquest.
This meant the exchanges between the colonizers and the natives were often brutal.
The colonists had the technological advantage in terms of weapons, and the natives had an edge in using the environment that they knew so well.
Religion also played another major role in South and North America.
The natives were expected to conform to Christianity and missionaries were deployed to convert the indigenous people.
It didn't occur to many Europeans that the native people may have had existing cultures and religious beliefs of their own.
Some of the Spanish missionaries were able to spend more time with the natives than others and came to sympathize with them and understand their cause.
Pope Paul III read the letters of the missionaries and warned colonists that the native people were not beasts to be killed or enslaved, but human beings with souls capable of salvation.
This was quite an enlightened outlook for the time.
And although it conceded that Christianity was the only true way forward, the Pope indicated that colonists should at least be mindful of the plight of the natives.
Still, the physical shock alone must have been tremendous.
Neither side had seen anything quite like the other, and the first contacts evoked a mass array of emotions, ranging from mild curiosity to derision and fear.
Some settlers realized that befriending natives would work in their favor.
The locals knew the land better than them and they could learn how to farm it and hunt on it.
When the British initially settled at Rowanoke in 1585, they struck up a relationship with the local Algangquin people.
The Algangquin showed them how to crop the land and where to find food.
So good was this relationship that many believe the struggling settlers may have simply opted to live with the Alangquins.
All of this aside, no matter what industry their colonies were based on, all the European powers needed labor.
And when the job proved to be too much for the settlers and disease wiped out the enslaved natives, the colonists began bringing slaves over from West Africa.
And so after the first 100 years of American colonization, Spain was the clear winner in terms of territories and riches gained.
The Spanish had established colonies from Buenos Aries all the way up to Florida and Texas.
However, France was about to have a massive influence and England had only gotten started.
In North America, at least, massive changes were on the near horizon.

# 1592
00:22:43 - 00:23:54

16世纪末，欧洲对美洲的殖民统治已经全面展开。
西班牙已成为该地区的超级大国，征服了几乎整个南美洲，并逐步向充满希望的北美洲扩张。
1494 年的《托尔图瓦条约》宣布，分界线以西的所有领土都属于西班牙。
理论上讲，英国、法国和荷兰对此一笑置之，继续执行他们的计划，对西班牙和葡萄牙的天真傲慢摇头叹息。
1592年，美洲殖民地的景象大致如下。
葡萄牙殖民了巴西，在东海岸沿线建立了零星的定居点。
首府是位于东北部巴希亚地区的萨尔瓦多，葡萄牙的佩德罗·卡布拉尔于 1500 年首次在此宣布对巴西拥有主权。
西班牙的努力取得了最大的成果，其领土遍布加勒比海、墨西哥、中美洲和南美洲的大部分地区。
对西班牙来说，一切都与黄金和白银有关。

At the close of the 16th century, the European colonization of the Americas was well and truly underway.
Spain had emerged as the region's superpower, conquering almost all of South America and making snaking inroads into the promising North America.
The Treaty of Tortois of 1494 declares that all territories to the west of the demarcation line belongs to Spain.
In theory anyway, England, France, and the Netherlands had simply laughed this off and went ahead with their plans, shaking their heads at Spain and Portugal's naive arrogance.
In 1592, the American colonies looked something like this.
Portugal had colonized Brazil with settlements scattered up and down the eastern coast.
The capital was Salvador in the northeastern region of Bajia where Portugal's Pedro Cabral had first claimed Brazil in 1500.
Spain had the most to show for its efforts with territories throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and the bulk of South America.
For Spain, it was all about the gold and silver.

# Importance of Gold and Silver
00:23:54 - 00:25:10

新大陆的矿藏为西班牙创造的财富比葡萄牙人从非洲开采的任何财富都要多。
1585 年，英国人曾尝试在北卡罗来纳州的罗瓦诺克建立早期殖民地，但这次尝试以失败告终。
然而，英国的征程才刚刚开始，他们正计划以更加睿智和坚定的决心重返北美。
法国还深入加拿大以及东海岸一带。
虽然还没有正式的定居点建立，但派遣一支完整的殖民者舰队似乎只是时间问题。
同样，荷兰人也率先抓住机会，在新世界开发贸易和定居机会。
从世纪之交开始，局势变得更加紧张激烈。
英国人在罗瓦诺克殖民地被遗弃，事情一开始就对英国人来说很糟糕。
但英国非但没有气馁，反而决定继续向北在弗吉尼亚州建立殖民地。
首先，英国人意识到他们需要改善其传教活动的资金来源。

The mines in the new world were producing more wealth for Spain than anything the Portuguese had ever been able to extract from Africa.
In 1585, the British had attempted an early colony at Rowanoke in North Carolina, but the venture was a disaster.
However, Britain was just getting started, and plans were being laid to return to North America wiser and more determined.
France had also delved into Canada and up and down the east coast.
Although no official settlements had been established, it seemed only a matter of time before a full fleet of colonists would be dispatched.
Similarly, the Dutch were primes to send their own opportunities to exploit trade and settlement opportunities in the new world.
From the turn of the century, the action really heated up.
Things had started badly for the British with the abandoned colony at Rowanoke.
But far from discouraged, Britain simply decided to colonize further up the American coast in Virginia.
First, the British decided they needed to improve the financing of their missions.

# Financing the English Colonies
00:25:10 - 00:25:47

这促成了股份制公司的诞生。
这些股份制公司的运作方式与今天的大型企业非常相似，投资者购买贸易公司的股份并获得一部分利润。
股份公司筹集到的资金比英国王室多得多。
1966年，弗吉尼亚公司向东海岸派遣了一支由殖民者和士兵组成的舰队。
弗吉尼亚州是以伊丽莎白女王的名字命名的，伊丽莎白女王被称为“童贞女王”，因为她终身未婚。

This led to the creation of joint stock companies.
These stock companies functioned much like major corporations of today where investors bought shares in a trading company and received a portion of the profits.
The stock companies were able to drum up much more money than the English monarchy could.
And in6006, the Virginia Company sent a fleet of colonists and soldiers to the east coast.
Virginia was named after Queen Elizabeth, who was known as the Virgin Queen because she never married.

# First English Colony
00:25:47 - 00:26:00

位于弗吉尼亚州切萨皮克湾的詹姆斯敦，以国王詹姆斯一世的名字命名。
在更北的东海岸，法国努力建立持久的殖民地，但恶劣的条件和竞争对手的阻挠使早期的几次尝试都以失败告终。

named after King James I.
Further up the eastern coast, France struggled to establish lasting colonies as harsh conditions and rival powers doomed several early efforts.

# Founding of Quebec & New France
00:26:00 - 00:26:49

公元6008年，塞缪尔·德·沙普兰在魁北克建立了第一个持久定居点，该定居点主要用作毛皮贸易站。
从这里开始，皮毛商人在圣劳伦斯河沿岸建立起贸易站，并与当地居民，如阿尔冈昆人和阿布纳基人建立了联系。
圣劳伦斯河沿岸地区后来被称为新法兰西或加拿大。
后者源自伊拉克语“canata”，意为村庄或定居点。
毛皮贸易蓬勃发展，法国人非常依赖当地人娴熟的剥皮技术。
尽管偶尔也会出现争端，但贸易关系逐渐形成。

In6008, Samuel de Chaplain founded the first lasting settlement at Quebec, which was mainly set up to act as a fur trading post.
From here, fur traders began setting up operations along the St.
Lawrence River and forming relations with the local people such as the Algangquin and Abnaki tribes.
The region along the St.
Lawrence River came to be known as New France or Canada.
The latter coming from the native Irakcoyan word canata meaning village or settlement.
Trade for furs really took off and the French were dependent on the native smooth skills with skinning animal hides.
Trading relations were gradually formed albeit with occasional disputes.
Not to be left out, in6009 Dutch merchants hired the English captain Henry Hudson to make the trek across the Atlantic.

# Dutch Arrival in North America
00:26:49 - 00:27:48

荷兰商人雇佣了英国船长亨利·哈德逊横渡大西洋。
荷兰人最初希望哈德逊能够找到一条穿越西北航道的航线，希望找到一条连接大西洋和太平洋的路线。
哈德逊找到了通往哈德逊河的路，并将河口的海湾划归荷兰所有。
荷兰人的计划是将这个殖民地建设成一个贸易中心，而不是像英国人那样发展成农业中心。
荷兰西印度公司成立于 1621 年，主要业务是利润丰厚的毛皮贸易。
1624年，荷兰殖民者来到这里，在今天曼哈顿岛的顶端建立了新阿姆斯特丹。
这座城市成为了繁荣的贸易港口，美洲原住民非常乐意用毛皮换取枪支、羊毛毯和金属工具。

The Dutch originally wanted Hudson to navigate a way through the Northwest Passage, hoping to find a route connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Hudson found his way to the Hudson River and claimed the bay at the mouth of the river for the Netherlands.
The Dutch plan was to make this colony a trading center instead of the agricultural model favored by the British.
The Dutch West India Company was set up in 1621 with the main focus being on the lucrative fur trade.
In 1624, Dutch settlers came over and founded New Amsterdam there on the tip of today's Manhattan Island.
The city became a thriving trade port with the Native Americans only too happy to trade fur in return for firearms, wool blankets, and metal tools.
Life was tough from the get-go for the colonists.

# The Hardship of first Colonies
00:27:48 - 00:30:00

殖民者的生活从一开始就十分艰辛。
他们中许多人来自家乡的富裕家庭，或者是工匠和手工艺人。
他们当中很少有人习惯于建立和运营殖民地所需的艰苦体力劳动。
此外，恶劣的天气、与土著部落的持续战斗以及饥荒最终导致一些人走向了食人行为。
许多詹姆斯敦的定居者来到美洲，都希望通过发现黄金而致富。
当它没有到来时，许多人就放弃了。
更多的人则不幸丧生。
到 1610 年，只剩下大约一百人了。
詹姆斯敦最终得以保存，要归功于约翰·史密斯船长和探险家约翰·罗尔夫的努力和远见。
史密斯在艰难时期鼓舞了殖民者，并认识到与当地塞纳卡莫科部落建立关系的明智之处。
当地土著居民教会了殖民者如何耕种土地以及在哪里狩猎。
史密斯曾说过一句名言：不劳动者不得食，以此说服詹姆斯敦的人们坚持下去。
1610年，约翰·罗尔夫从南美洲引进了烟草植物，他们的命运也随之改变。
现在弗吉尼亚州有了一种能带来持续收入的作物，土地开始被清理出来种植烟草。
由于英国、法国和荷兰实行的是重商主义体系，因此烟草等资源的种植至关重要。
重商主义认为世界财富是有限的，一个国家只有通过牺牲他国的利益才能致富。
因此，需要尽量减少进口，尽量增加出口，以实现贸易顺差。
殖民地使被殖民者能够生产资源而无需从竞争对手那里进口，同时将剩余资源出售以促进出口，从而创造贸易顺差。
英国和法国王室与商人密切合作，规范贸易以实现这一目标，并通常禁止其殖民地与竞争对手重商主义强国进行贸易。
英国人的定居活动也发生在更北边的东海岸。

Many were from privileged families back home or were artisans and craftsmen.
Few of them were used to the hard physical labor that was required to get the colony up and running.
Added to this was unforgiving weather, ongoing battles with native tribes, and periods of starvation, which eventually drove some to cannibalism.
Many of the James Town settlers had come to America expecting to get rich by discovering gold.
When it didn't come, many gave up.
Many more simply perished.
And by 1610, there was only a hundred or so left.
James Town was ultimately saved by the efforts and vision of Captain John Smith and the explorer John Rolf.
Smith rallied the colonists through the hard times and saw the wisdom in building relationships with the local Senakamokco tribe.
The natives taught the colonists how to farm the land and where to hunt.
Smith famously told the settlers that he who does not work shall not eat and convinced the Jamestown people to hang on.
Their fortunes changed in 1610 when John Rolf introduced the tobacco plant from South America.
Now Virginia had a crop that would bring in repeat revenue and land started being cleared for tobacco plantations.
Cultivation of resources like tobacco was vital since Britain, France, and the Dutch operated in a system of mercantalism.
Mercantalism held that the world's wealth was finite and a nation only became rich at the expense of others.
Therefore, imports needed to be minimized and exports maximized to achieve a positive balance of trade.
Colonies allowed the colonized to produce resources without the need to import them from rival powers while selling the rest to boost their exports, creating a positive trade balance.
The British and French crowns worked closely with merchants to regulate trade to achieve this goal and generally forbade their colonies from trading with rival mercantilist powers.
English settlement was also taking place further up the east coast.

# New Settlements & Conflicts
00:30:00 - 00:36:15

1620年，清教徒乘坐五月花号抵达普利茅斯，并在后来的马萨诸塞州定居下来。
清教徒和其他许多早期欧洲移民一样，因宗教迫害或对家乡的宗教秩序不满而来到美洲。
其他定居者是流离失所的农民、以前的佣人或退伍军人。
许多人被承诺在完成约定的劳动合同后，将获得自己的土地。
就像在弗吉尼亚州一样，早期的清教徒也饱受饥荒和环境问题的困扰，但在早期得到了当地部落的帮助。
然而，当当地部落意识到殖民者打算长期居住并意图夺取他们的土地时，双方关系很快恶化。
欧洲人最初计划与当地土著合作。
许多幸存的殖民者学会了与当地土著居民一起生活，或者至少学会了共存。
当地部落教会了定居者如何耕种土地，种植什么作物，以及在哪里狩猎。
反过来，殖民者也提供了大量有用且令人向往的商品。
金属工具、布料、武器、炊具和镜子很容易进行交易，珠宝和酒类也是如此。
动物皮毛衣服被棉质衬衫和服装所取代。
事实证明，金属锅碗瓢盆比陶制炊具更好用。
欧洲的燧石和钢片使生火变得容易得多。
当然，如果没有某种形式的基本沟通，这一切都不可能发生。
融入其他社会的当地人或定居者被证明是非常有价值的联络人，他们能够说多种语言。
一些当地居民被俘虏并被迫成为双语导游，而双方的人们则经常选择生活在对方的文化社会中。
在一些地区，随着通婚数量的增加，定居者和当地居民之间的关系变得稍微缓和了一些。
这些婚姻有助于增进不同文化之间的相互了解，并带来了培养双语儿童的好处。
然而，许多土著居民进行了抵抗，他们宁愿死也不愿为欧洲入侵者工作或屈服。
甚至一些最初试图与欧洲人合作的人，也很快转而反对他们。
例如，塞纳卡莫科人最初接受了与詹姆斯敦殖民者的贸易，但英国人的野心和对土著居民的暴力行为导致双方在 1610 年爆发公开冲突。
只有约翰·罗尔夫与被俘的土著女子波卡洪塔斯的婚姻才使这两个民族在短时间内和解。
然而，1618 年在位酋长波哈坦去世后，两国关系再次破裂。
1622年，塞纳卡莫克人对弗吉尼亚殖民地发动了一场残酷的袭击，造成300多名定居者死亡。
这激起了定居者的报复性暴力，并引发了接下来20 年的暴力冲突，最终导致英国人从火力不足的塞纳卡莫科人手中夺取了大片土地。
同样，荷兰人和新阿姆斯特丹与当地土著居民的关系也破裂了。
他们声称是荷兰人将全球贸易和基督教信仰介绍给了当地土著居民。
不出所料，这对当地居民来说毫无意义，他们拒绝支付荷兰人要求的额外费用。
1655 年爆发了激烈的战斗，荷兰人让他们的非洲奴隶在城市东北部的新阿姆斯特丹周围建造了一道防护墙。
沿着这堵墙延伸的街道，如今已成为纽约市最著名的街道——华尔街。
与此同时，在南美洲，17世纪葡萄牙也决定投入更多资金发展其巴西殖民地。
约翰三世国王希望把这件事做好，所以他任命汤米·扎为巴西总督。
萨是一位经验丰富的管理者，曾在葡萄牙的非洲和亚洲殖民地担任要职。
1549 年，SOA 在萨尔瓦多建立了殖民地首府，将巴西划分为总督辖区或土地分配区，并建立了以葡萄牙为蓝本的市政组织。
到 1600 年，巴吉亚和佩伦博库各有约 2000 名居民，奴隶数量是居民数量的两倍多。
但对于葡萄牙来说，一切并非一帆风顺。
法国和荷兰曾冒险进入巴西，并对他们所看到的景象感到满意。
这意味着从 6 世纪中叶到 17世纪，葡萄牙一直在与法国和荷兰的入侵者作战。
1624年，荷兰人短暂占领了萨尔瓦多首都，但里斯本派出一支庞大的军队进入该城，夺回了控制权。
当葡萄牙开始在巴西加紧建立定居点时，西班牙正从其金银矿中赚取巨额财富。
这一切都由秘鲁总督辖区监督，该辖区成立于 16 世纪，总部设在利马。
该地区控制着南美洲的大片地区，丰富的白银储量使利马成为西班牙继墨西哥城之后第二重要的城市。
欧洲的人们开始对这些新机遇表现出浓厚的兴趣，移民也开始源源不断地涌入。
由于有大量贵重货物在海上运输，欧洲列强资助私掠船（一种由政府支持的海盗），骚扰和劫掠敌对国家的船只。
当时没有船只能够安全横渡大西洋，西班牙只好组建护航船队，配备重装武装的护卫舰。
从这些新殖民地榨取财富需要大量的劳动力。
疾病和冲突导致当地人口急剧减少，定居者数量不足以完成所有必要的工作。
于是欧洲人开始奴役奴隶。

In 1620, Puritans arrived on the Mayflower ship and settled at Plymouth in what would become Massachusetts.
The Puritans were like many of the other early European settlers, driven to the Americas by religious persecution or being dissatisfied with the religious order back home.
Other settlers were displaced farmers, former servants, or retired soldiers.
Many were promised their own plots of land after completing an agreed upon contract of labor.
Just as in Virginia, the early Puritans also struggled with famine and the environment, but were aided in the early days by native tribes.
The relationship soon soured, though, when the local tribes realized the colonists were there to stay and intent on taking their land.
The Europeans had originally planned to work with the natives.
Many of the surviving colonists learned to live with the natives, or at least to coexist.
Native tribes taught settlers how to farm the land, what crops to grow, and where to hunt.
In turn, the colonists provided plenty of useful and desirable goods.
Metal tools, fabrics, weapons, cooking utensils, and mirrors were readily traded, as were jewelry and alcohol.
Animal skin clothes were replaced by cotton shirts and garments.
Metal pots and pans proved to be better than clay utensils.
and the European flint and steel made starting fires far easier.
Of course, none of this could have taken place without at least some form of basic communication.
Natives or settlers who immerse themselves in the other society proved to be highly valuable liaison who could speak several languages.
Some natives were captured and forced to become bilingual guides while people from both sides often chose to live in the other cultures society.
Relations between the settlers and natives became somewhat easier in some parts with increasing numbers of marriages.
These marriages helped develop understanding between vastly different cultures and had the benefit of producing bilingual children.
However, many indigenous people resisted and would have rather died than work or yield to the European invaders.
Even some of those who tried to cooperate with the Europeans soon turned against them.
For example, the Senakamoko initially accepted trade with the Jamestown settlers, but English ambitions and episodes of violence against native peoples led to open conflict in 1610.
Only the marriage of John Rolf with a captured native woman named Pocahontas reconciled the two peoples for a short while.
However, after the death of the reigning chief Pohatan in 1618, relations collapsed again.
In 1622, the Senakamokco launched a brutal attack on the Virginia colony that killed over 300 settlers.
This provoked retaliatory violence from the settlers and another 20 years of violence that resulted in the English seizing vast amounts of land from the outgunned Senakamokco.
Similarly, the Dutch and New Amsterdam suffered a breakdown in relations with native peoples.
They had claimed the Dutch introduced the natives to global trade and the Christian faith.
Not surprisingly, this meant nothing to the natives, who refused to pay extra payments demanded by the Dutch.
Violent battles erupted in 1655, and the Dutch had their African slaves build a protective wall around New Amsterdam in the city's northeast.
The street that ran along this wall is now the most famous in New York City, Wall Street.
Meanwhile, in South America, the 17th century also saw Portugal deciding to spend more money on developing its Brazilian colonies.
King John III wanted it to be done properly, so he appointed Tommy Dza as governor general of Brazil.
Sa was an experienced administrator who'd served well in Portugal's African and Asian settlements.
SOA founded the colonial capital at Salvador in 1549, divided Brazil up into captaincies or land aotment regions, and set up municipal organizations modeled on those back in Portugal.
By 1600, Bajia and Perumboku each had around 2,000 citizens and more than double that in slaves.
It wasn't all smooth sailing, though, for Portugal.
France and the Dutch had ventured into Brazil and liked what they saw.
This meant from the mid6th to 17th centuries, Portugal was constantly fighting off French and Dutch invaders.
In 1624, the Dutch briefly took over the capital of Salvador, but Lisbon sent a large battalion into the city to wrangle back control.
While Portugal had started to ramp up settlements in Brazil, Spain was making a fortune from its gold and silver mines.
This was all overseen by the vice royalty of Peru, which was a district set up in the 16th century with its headquarters in Lima.
The district controlled a massive chunk of South America, and the vast supplies of silver made Lima Spain's second most important city after Mexico City.
People back in Europe started to take keen interest in these new opportunities and settlers began arriving steadily.
With so much valuable cargo traveling the sea, European powers funded privateeers, a kind of government-backed pirate, to harass and capture the ships of rival nations.
No ships were safe traveling across the Atlantic and Spain resorted to forming convoys with heavily armed bodyguard type ships.
Extracting the wealth from these new colonies required vast amounts of labor.
Disease and conflict had sharply reduced the native population and there weren't enough settlers to do all the needed work.
So the Europeans turned to slaves.

# Slavery
00:36:15 - 00:38:27

17世纪上半叶，大西洋奴隶贸易主要由葡萄牙人和西班牙人控制。
迄今为止，数量最多的非洲奴隶被送往墨西哥，其余的则被运往加勒比海的西班牙殖民地和葡萄牙统治下的巴西。
葡萄牙之所以能获得最多的奴隶，是因为它控制了西非的安哥拉、佛得角和几内亚巴绍等地区。
奴隶要么是从非洲部落购买的，要么是被强行掳掠而来，然后直接运往巴西或西班牙的伊斯帕尼奥拉岛。
由于伊比利亚联盟，葡萄牙和西班牙在1580年至1640年间实现了统一。
早期的主要作物是糖。
欧洲对糖的需求不断增长，并在 18 世纪达到了顶峰。
种植甘蔗是一项艰苦的工作。
这是一项极其艰苦的工作，而且是在闷热的环境下进行的。
换句话说，这是一份奴隶才会做的工作。
一些奴隶船遭到敌对国家舰队的攻击。
英国私掠船经常袭击西班牙奴隶船，甚至袭击加勒比海的奴隶殖民地。
这就是英国人如何获得第一批奴隶并将其用于美洲殖民地的方式。
1619年，英国私掠船袭击了一艘西班牙奴隶船，劫走了奴隶，然后把他们送到弗吉尼亚的烟草种植园做工。
随着殖民地的发展，英国人、法国人和荷兰人对奴隶制投入巨大。
到 1625 年，已有超过32 万名奴隶从非洲被运往美国。
到 19 世纪，这个数字最终将超过 1200 万。
到7世纪中叶，欧洲列强之间对新大陆土地和资源的争夺异常激烈。
为了获取加勒比海的糖分，英国人在 1627 年在巴巴多斯定居，随后在 1628 年在新阿斯河定居，然后在 1632 年在蒙塞拉特和安提瓜定居。

For the first half of the 17th century, the Atlantic slave trade was largely run by the Portuguese and Spanish.
By far, the greatest number of African slaves were sent to Mexico, with others being shipped to Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and to Portuguese Brazil.
Portugal had the greatest access to slaves because it controlled areas in West Africa such as Angola, Cape Verde, and Guinea Basau.
Slaves were bought or simply seized from African tribes and shipped either directly to Brazil or to Spanish Hispanola.
Thanks to the Iberian Union, Portugal and Spain were united from 1580 to 1640.
The main crop in the early days was sugar.
The demand for sugar was on the rise in Europe and would go through the roof in the 18th century.
Farming sugar was tough work.
It was a backbreaking job carried out in stifling heat.
In other words, a job fit for slaves.
Some slave ships were attacked by fleets from rival countries.
British privateeers often raided Spanish slave ships or even slave colonies in the Caribbean.
This is how the British acquired their first slaves to be used in the American colonies.
In 1619, British privateeers attacked a Spanish slave ship, stole the slaves, and then sent them to Virginia to work on the tobacco plantations.
As their colonies developed, the English, French, and Dutch became heavily invested in slavery.
By 1625, more than 320,000 slaves had been shipped over from Africa.
This number would ultimately rise to over 12 million by the 19th century.
By the mid7th century, competition between European powers for land and resources in the new world was fierce.
Seeking access to Caribbean sugar in 1627, the English settled in Barbados, followed by NeAs in 1628 and then Monserat and Antigua in 1632.
In 1638, another European power decided to get in on the act when the colony of New Sweden was founded by the Swedish South Company.

# Swedish Arrival in North America
00:38:27 - 00:39:12

瑞典南方公司建立了新瑞典殖民地。
这是瑞典、荷兰和德国商业利益集团的合资企业，他们热衷于在东海岸建立贸易联系。
新瑞典的基地位于特拉华河沿岸，在今天的特拉华州、宾夕法尼亚州和新泽西州都有定居点。
这些欧洲列强之间的冲突经常在殖民地上演。
例如，在三十年战争期间，英国入侵法属加拿大，围攻并占领了魁北克，尽管他们在 1632 年将其归还给了法国。
在接下来的 100 年左右的时间里，这成为了一种常见的模式。

This was a joint venture of Swedish, Dutch, and German business interests who were keen to set up trade links on the east coast.
New Sweden was based along the Delaware River with settlements in today's Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.
Conflicts between these European powers regularly played out in the colonies.
For example, Britain invaded French Canada during the 30 Years War, besieging and capturing Quebec, although they handed it back to the French in 1632.
This was to be a familiar pattern over the next 100 or so years.

# Conflicts with Natives
00:39:12 - 00:42:36

欧洲的冲突对美国的权力平衡产生了巨大影响。
当然，欧洲的扩张是以牺牲土著居民的利益为代价的。
欧洲人来自与牛、猪、羊、鸡等家畜共同生活的文化中。
这带来了这些民族完全陌生的新型疾病。
天花、流感、斑疹伤寒、黄热病和麻疹对美洲来说都是新的疾病，并很快在当地土著居民中传播开来。
武器很容易与定居者进行交易，其中火器最受欢迎。
这加剧了部落间的暴力冲突，因为土著居民开始使用更先进的武器互相攻击。
随着当地居民迅速熟练地使用火枪和手枪，战争变得更加致命。
这种更容易获得致命武器的途径对当地人口下降产生了另一个显著影响。
这也给环境造成了严重破坏。
由于许多土著居民想要更多的枪支，他们开始猎杀更多的动物以获取毛皮，并开垦更多的土地。
土壤侵蚀成了一个问题。
在新英格兰，野生动物栖息地和物种受到威胁，而到了18 世纪，海狸几乎已经灭绝。
当时人们对它们的皮毛需求量非常大。
海狸的消失意味着池塘的消失，这导致鱼类数量减少，也减少了鹿和驼鹿等其他动物的饮水处。
欧洲人引进了猪、山羊和牛等家畜，这些家畜被允许四处游荡，自由地吃掉许多原本是鹿吃的食物，这进一步减少了狩猎的选择。
酒精对当地土著居民来说真是一场灾难。
有些人很快就染上了毒瘾，导致过早死亡、家庭破裂和部落结构瓦解。
部落长老们自然表达了他们的不满，并尽一切努力限制消费。
但许多领导人自己也染上了毒瘾，使问题更加严重。
据估计，在哥伦布抵达后的 150 年里，美洲原住民失去了大约 80% 的人口。
从1492 年到 1650 年，人口数量从 5000 万骤降至仅 800 万。
17 世纪即将过半时，自哥伦布首次登陆美洲以来，已经发生了巨大的变化。
原住民人口锐减，奴隶制即将成为一个蓬勃发展的产业。
西班牙仍然是绝对的霸主，但看似取之不尽的金银供应开始逐渐减少。
巴西正逐渐发展成为一个强大的南美国家，而葡萄牙人和西班牙人则通过伊比利亚联盟紧密联系在一起。
与此同时，另外两个欧洲超级大国英国和法国也明确表明了它们的意图。
他们都体验过北美的生活，非常喜欢，并且打算长期留在这里。
接下来的100年左右将会带来更大的变化，彻底改变人们所知的世界。

Conflicts in Europe having a huge influence on the balance of power in America.
Of course, this European expansion came at the expense of indigenous peoples.
The Europeans came from cultures that lived with domesticated animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens.
This brought new strains of disease that were completely foreign to these people.
Smallox, influenza, typhus, yellow fever, and measles were all new to the Americas and were soon spread throughout the native populations.
Weapons were readily traded with the settlers with firearms being the most sought after.
This increased the level of violence between tribes as natives began using the more advanced weapons on each other.
War was now more lethal as the natives became quickly proficient in the use of musketss and pistols.
This easy access to deadlier weapons had another telling effect on the native population decline.
It also took a serious toll on the environment.
Because many natives wanted more guns, they began hunting more animals for their furs and clearing more land.
Soil erosion became a problem.
While wildlife habitats and species became threatened in New England, beavers were virtually extinct by the 18th century.
Such was the demand for their fur.
No more beavers meant no more ponds, which reduced fish numbers and watering holes for other animals such as deer and moose.
Europeans introduced farm animals such as pigs, goats, and cows, which were allowed to wander around grazing freely on much of the food traditionally eaten by deer, which further reduced the hunting options.
Alcohol was a real scourge on the indigenous populations.
Some people quickly became addicted, leading to early deaths, broken homes, and the breakdown of tribal structures.
Tribal elders naturally voiced their disapproval and did all they could to limit consumption.
But many leaders themselves became addicted, compounding the problem.
It's estimated that in the 150 years that followed Columbus's arrival, the American natives lost roughly 80% of their population.
Between 1492 and 1650, the numbers had plummeted from 50 million to just 8 million.
As the 17th century neared its halfway point, there had already been huge changes since Columbus first landed in the Americas.
Native populations had been decimated and slavery was about to become a booming industry.
Spain was still very much the dominant power, but the seemingly endless supplies of silver and gold were beginning to trickle out.
Brazil was slowly building into a formidable South American country, and the Portuguese and Spanish were bonded via the Iberian Union.
Meanwhile, the other two European superpowers, Britain and France, had made their intentions clear.
They'd both had a taste of what North America had to offer, and they liked it a lot, and were in it for the long haul.
The next 100 or so years were about to bring further changes that would completely transform the world as everyone knew it.

00:42:36 - 00:43:26

哥伦布抵达美洲 150 年后，欧洲对美洲的殖民取得了巨大成功，五大欧洲殖民强国都为自己瓜分了新世界的大片领土，迫使当地居民要么适应、接受，要么反抗（如果他们还没有死于疾病的话）。
17 世纪下半叶只会证明欧洲人将继续留在这里，因为新世界成为了欧洲战争、激进的政治和宗教实验以及建立在仆人和奴隶血汗之上的利润丰厚的产业的舞台。
欧洲殖民化进程变得越来越快，越来越激烈。

150 years after Columbus's arrival, European colonization of the Americas had seen great success, the five major European colonial powers had all carved out significant chunks of the new world for themselves, forcing those already there to adapt, accept, or resist if they hadn't already died from disease.
The second half of the 17th century would only prove that the Europeans were there to stay as the new world became the arena for imported European wars, radical political and religious experiments, and lucrative industries built off the backs of servants and slaves.
The story of European colonization was only getting faster and more intense.
We'll start with England, or rather New England, which by 1650 boasted 40 towns and 23,000 colonists.

# New England
00:43:26 - 00:49:09

或者更确切地说是新英格兰，到 1650 年，那里已经拥有 40 个城镇和 23,000 名殖民者。
意识到自身日益增长的繁荣和共同的文化，新英格兰联盟于 1643 年成立，旨在联合马萨诸塞湾、普利茅斯、康涅狄格和纽黑文等殖民地，这预示着未来殖民地之间的合作。
罗德岛这个被排斥的小殖民地被排除在邦联之外，纽黑文在 1664 年被康涅狄格州完全吞并。
但新英格兰已经初具雏形。
宗教异议、与美洲原住民有着深厚联系的边疆精神以及对脱离王室的自豪文化，这些都使新英格兰与旧英格兰截然不同。
从经济角度来看，新英格兰从来都不是英国殖民地中最赚钱的。
西印度群岛创造的财富远远超过新英格兰，但新英格兰人所能享受的生活质量却很高。
普通家庭可以期望拥有土地来耕种自己所需的作物，而有产者则可以期望在政治中扮演比大西洋彼岸的典型英国人更直接的角色。
虽然加勒比海地区的糖业财富使新英格兰的经济黯然失色，但新英格兰也受益于良好的农业用地、丰富的渔业资源和大量的木材森林。
到 1700 年，新英格兰的渔业和造船业已跻身世界一流之列，英国甚至从他们那里购买了一些船只。
对大多数新英格兰人来说，殖民地生活最重要的是让他们可以自由地按照自己的意愿进行宗教活动。
随着包括浸信会教徒、国会教徒和贵格会教徒在内的更广泛的宗教教派涌向新世界的自由，清教主义在新英格兰的统治地位已经开始衰落。
然而，事情并非表面看起来那么简单。
宗教宽容的定义受到新教异见者的严格限制。
英国国教徒和天主教徒都不受欢迎。
即使是贵格会教徒也面临着严重的歧视。
他们在17 世纪 50 年代被驱逐出马萨诸塞州，至少有四名贵格会教徒因宣扬他们的信仰而被绞死。
新英格兰的宗教情绪高涨，而1691年和1692年的塞勒姆女巫审判案则充分展现了这种情绪的危险性。
当时，强烈的偏执导致数百人被指控，19人因臆想中的巫术罪而被处决。
与土著居民的关系也很困难。
1675年，新英格兰与阿尔冈昆土著发生了一系列冲突，阿尔冈昆土著由一位名叫梅塔科姆的战士领导，但英国人称他为菲利普国王。
新英格兰人要求梅塔科姆特的人民交出武器和土地，梅塔科姆特起初同意了，但随着他们的要求越来越大，他知道他们要么反抗，要么失去一切。
菲利普国王的战争导致新英格兰一半以上的城镇遭到袭击，十几个城镇被夷为平地，而对阿尔冈昆人的残酷报复导致梅塔科马特部下的许多定居点和粮食储备被摧毁。
这场战争一直持续到 1676 年 8 月，当时梅塔克被一名皈依基督教的印第安人枪杀，失去了他的领导，土著联盟瓦解了。
战争结束后，人们对美洲原住民的愤怒情绪十分强烈，一些弗吉尼亚人甚至呼吁将美洲原住民彻底驱逐出该地区。
弗吉尼亚州州长威廉·伯克利拒绝了这一提议，但很快发现自己面临着不满的弗吉尼亚人发动的叛乱。
1676 年，以领导人纳撒尼尔·培根命名的培根起义要求罢免伯克利，并将美洲原住民彻底驱逐出弗吉尼亚州。
叛乱很快被政府的效忠者镇压，但在此之前，几个效忠者的定居点遭到袭击，100 多名美洲原住民被杀。
尽管培根的叛乱只持续了几个月，但它之所以引人注目，主要有两个原因。
首先，这场战争涉及白人定居者和非洲人，包括奴隶和非奴隶，他们与美洲原住民对抗。
意识到这两个群体可能会联合起来，殖民政府在法律上对黑人和白人进行了更严格的隔离，以确保他们不会再次起义，但这从长远来看加剧了种族分裂和敌意。
这也是殖民者第一次大规模反抗殖民统治的起义。
这并非最后一次，未来的历史学家们从培根起义中看到了百年后美国革命的最初种子。
新英格兰剩余的印第安人四散奔逃，或沦为奴隶，或被迫成为所谓“祈祷镇”的二等公民。
这些“祈祷镇”本应是基督教皈依的中心，但实际上大多是保留地。
新英格兰人和当地居民之间的敌意依然存在。
马萨诸塞州牧师所罗门·斯托达德在 1682 年写给州长的信中，最能体现这种态度，他建议训练狗来猎杀印第安人。
引述道：“他们的行为如同狼群，必须像对待狼群一样对待他们。
”从新英格兰向北迁徙的荷兰人在新尼德兰也渴望确立自己的地位。

Conscious of their rising prosperity and shared cultures, the New England Confederation was formed in 1643 to unify the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven in what proved to be foreshadowing for future colonial cooperation.
The small outcast colony of Rhode Island was omitted from the Confederation and New Haven was annexed entirely by Connecticut in 1664.
But already New England was taking a recognizable shape.
Religious disscent, a frontier mentality with deep connections to the Native Americans and a proud culture of independence from the crown defined New England against the old.
Economically, New England was never the most lucrative of England's colonies.
The West Indies far outclassed it in wealth generated, but the quality of life New Englanders could enjoy was high.
The average family could expect to own lands to farm what they needed, and propertied men could expect a role in influencing politics that was more direct than what a typical Englishman across the Atlantic would expect.
While the sugar fortunes of the Caribbean eclipsed New England's humble economy, it benefited from good agricultural land, vast fishing stocks, and huge forests for lumber.
By 1700, New England's fishing and ship building industries was among the best in the world, and England itself was buying some of its vessels from them.
Most importantly for most New Englanders, colonial life offered them the freedom to worship as they pleased.
Puritanism's dominance in New England was already fading as an even wider tapestry of religious denominations, including Baptists, congressionalists, and Quakers, flocked to the freedom of the new world.
Not all was as it seemed, though.
Religious toleration was defined in strict Protestant dissenter limits.
Anglicans were not welcome, nor Catholics.
And even the Quakers faced significant discrimination.
They were banished from Massachusetts in the 1650s, and at least four Quakers were hanged for preaching their faith.
Religious feeling was high in New England, and nothing showed the risks of that like the Salem witch trials of 1691 and 1692, where intense paranoia led to hundreds being accused and 19 people executed for the imagined crime of witchcraft.
Relations with the indigenous people were also difficult.
In 1675, New England experienced a wave of conflicts with the Algangquin natives, led by a warrior named Metacomt, but who was known to the English as King Phillip.
The New Englanders had demanded Metacomt's people surrender weapons and land to them, and Metacomt agreed at first, but as their demands grew, he knew they could either fight or lose everything.
King Philip's war led to more than half of New England's towns being attacked and a dozen being burned to the ground and harsh reprisals against the Algangquins led to the destruction of many settlements and food stores belonging to Metaccomat's men.
The war lasted until August 1676 when Metac was shot by an Indian Christian convert and the Native Alliance collapsed without his leadership.
Anger at Native Americans was intense in the wake of the war, and some Virginiaians called for the total expulsion of Native Americans from the territory.
Governor William Berkeley refused, but quickly found himself with a rebellion on his hands by discontented Virginiaians.
Bacon's rebellion in 1676, named for its leader, Nathaniel Bacon, called for Berkeley's dismissal and a total expulsion of Native Americans from Virginia.
The rebellion was swiftly put down by government loyalists, but not before several loyalist settlements were attacked and over 100 Native Americans were killed.
Although it lasted only a few months, Bacon's rebellion was remarkable for two key reasons.
First, it involved both white settlers and Africans, slave and non-slave, against the Native Americans.
The realization that the two groups might unify caused the colonial government to draw stricter legal separation between black and white to ensure they wouldn't rise up again, which encouraged racial division and hostility in the long term.
It was also the first significant rebellion by colonists against colonial rule.
It would not be the last and future historians have seen in Bacon's Rebellion the first seeds that would sprout into the American Revolution a century later.
The remaining Indians in New England scattered or were enslaved or were forced into secondass citizen status in so-called praying towns which were supposed to be the centers of Christian conversion but mostly functioned as reservations.
The hostility between New Englanders and natives remained.
And this attitude is best seen in the words of Massachusetts Minister Solomon Stoddard writing to the governor in 1682 who suggested dogs be trained to hunt Indians.
Quote, "They act like wolves and are to be dealt with as wolves.
" Moving north from New England, the Dutch in New Netherland were also eager to assert their place.

# The Collapse of New Netherlands & Dutch Brazil
00:49:09 - 00:52:42

荷兰人曾是美洲殖民扩张中的重要参与者。
凭借北部的荷兰新王国、加勒比海的多个岛屿以及在巴西的重要影响力，荷兰人已经瓜分了殖民帝国的一大块蛋糕。
然而，7 世纪中叶证明，荷兰军队已经不堪重负。
它们的广泛存在侵犯了多个敌对势力的利益，尤其是英国和葡萄牙的利益，从而引发了与它们的冲突。
自 1630 年以来，荷兰人从葡萄牙人手中夺取了巴西北部的一部分领土，并将其命名为新荷兰。
建立殖民地是他们打入糖业贸易的途径。
但是，荷兰定居者的数量相对较少，始终无法与巴西土著居民和葡萄牙定居者的数量相提并论，他们从未接受荷兰的统治。
1645年，葡萄牙人和新荷兰人发动叛乱，击败了荷兰军队，并邀请葡萄牙帝国占领该领土。
荷兰人紧急派遣远征军夺回殖民地，但在1648 年和 1649 年的瓜达佩斯战役中惨败。
巴西最后的荷兰殖民者在希法城坚守到 1654 年，葡萄牙最终将他们赶出了南美洲。
荷兰北部也发生了类似的灾难。
英国人意识到，新尼德兰将是与加拿大上游的法国人打交道的完美切入点，这将使他们能够控制东海岸一望无际的海岸线。
英国人意识到，荷兰人在巴西战败后过度消耗体力，身体虚弱。
因此，1664 年 8 月 27 日，英国船只驶入新阿姆斯特丹港，要求整个殖民地投降。
由于没有抵抗力量，荷兰殖民统治者投降了。
几个月后，第二次英荷战争在欧洲爆发。
这场战争不仅阻止了荷兰重新夺回殖民地的任何企图，也让英国有机会夺取其在加勒比海的一些属地，如多巴哥岛。
荷兰人确实从英国人手中夺取了苏里南，但随着 1667 年战争的结束，荷兰人显然失去了其作为美洲主要殖民强国之一的地位。
随着荷兰人在北美的势力被清除，英国人得以自由地扩大对东海岸的控制。
除了新英格兰、加拿大和卡罗拉群岛之外，英国人现在还不得不关注纽约、新泽西、宾夕法尼亚和特拉华等中部殖民地。
新尼德兰从荷兰人手中夺取时，由约克公爵詹姆斯统治，他是查理二世国王的弟弟，不久后他自己也成为了国王。
新阿姆斯特丹更名为纽约，但其荷兰居民基本没有受到干扰。
詹姆斯指示他任命的总督们要以温和的手段统治，但权力仍然牢牢掌握在他手中。
纽约没有民选议会，业主可以随心所欲地行使权力。
詹姆斯不可能远在千里之外，积极治理如此广阔的地区。
因此，在 1664 年，他割让了新尼德兰的一部分领土，将其授予他的盟友约翰·伯克利勋爵和约翰·卡特雷特爵士。

The Dutch had been a competitive player in American colonization.
With New Netherlands in the north, multiple islands in the Caribbean, and a valuable presence in Brazil, the Dutch had carved out a decent chunk of the colonial pie.
However, the mid-7th century proved that the Dutch were overstretched.
Their wide presence encroached on the interests of multiple rival powers, especially the British and the Portuguese, that provoked conflict with each.
Since 1630, the Dutch had claimed a portion of northern Brazil from the Portuguese, which they had dubbed New Holland.
The colony was their way to break into the sugar trade.
But the relatively low number of Dutch settlers were forever outnumbered by Brazilian natives and Portuguese settlers who never accepted Dutch rule.
In 1645, the Portuguese and New Holland rebelled, defeated the Dutch forces, and invited the Portuguese Empire to claim the territory.
The Dutch scrambled an expeditionary force to reclaim the colony, but they were decisively defeated at the two battles of Guadapes in 1648 and 1649.
The last Dutch colonists in Brazil held out in the city of Hifa until 1654 when Portugal finally kicked them out of South America.
The Dutch saw similar disaster up north.
The British recognized that New Netherland would be a perfect entry point to deal with the French upriver in Canada and would allow them to control the unbroken span of the eastern seabboard.
England realized that the Dutch had overexerted themselves and were weak in the wake of their defeats in Brazil.
So on August 27th, 1664, British ships sailed into the harbor of New Amsterdam and demanded the surrender of the entire colony.
With no forces to resist, the Dutch colonial administrators surrendered.
A few months later, the Second Anglo Dutch War erupted in Europe.
As well as preventing any Dutch attempts to reclaim the colonies, the war gave Britain the chance to seize some of its possessions in the Caribbean too, like Tobago.
The Dutch did manage to acquire Surinam from the British, but with the end of the war in 1667, the Dutch had clearly lost their place as one of the major colonial powers in the Americas.
With the Dutch out of the way in North America, the English were free to expand their control of the eastern seabboard.
Aside from New England, Canada, and the Carolas, the British now had to concern themselves with the middle colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.
When taken from the Dutch, New Netherland was under the control of James, Duke of York, the younger brother of King Charles II, and soon to be king himself.
New Amsterdam was renamed New York, but its Dutch inhabitants were mostly left alone.
James instructed his appointed governors to rule with a gentle hand, but power remained firmly in his grasp.
New York was given no elected assembly, and the proprietor could wield power as he pleased.
James could never hope to actively govern such a large area from so far away.
So in 1664 he cut off a chunk of New Netherlands to grant to his allies Lords John Berkeley and Sir John Carteret.

# The Quakers

而是将股份卖给了另一个团体——贵格会教徒。
贵格会教徒在英国曾遭受严重的迫害。
因此，殖民地为重新开始提供了绝佳的机会。
泽西岛不断迎来新的贵格会教徒定居者，壮大了当地原有的荷兰裔人口。
但贵格会殖民活动的真正成功之处在于宾夕法尼亚州。
宾夕法尼亚州成立于 1681 年，当时查理二世国王将土地所有权授予了贵格会金融家威廉·佩恩。
佩恩设想在大西洋彼岸建立一个新社会，让贵格会教徒和其他宗教少数群体能够和平生活，免受迫害。
1682年，约有2000名移民来到宾夕法尼亚，并在费城建立了首府；
1685年，又有约6000人迁入。
宾恩乐于将大片土地授予小农户，无论他们是否是贵格会教徒，以此来建设他的社会。
宾夕法尼亚州拥有民选议会和相当大的地方及个人自由，是新世界殖民的繁荣典范，但并非完美无缺。
一些较为坚定的贵格会教徒希望宾恩优先考虑建立宗教社团，而宾恩仍然是一位业主，他总是小心翼翼地确保利润不断攀升。
这导致一些贵格会教徒离开宾夕法尼亚州，转而前往由贵格会教徒控制的新泽西州。
但佩恩的努力似乎还是得到了回报。
到 1700 年，宾夕法尼亚州已有18,000 名殖民者，费城也迅速成为美国最大、最富有、教育水平最高的城市之一。

the Quakers.
The Quakers were heavily persecuted back in England.
So the colonies offered a perfect chance to start a new.
Jersey received a steady stream of new Quaker settlers to add to the existing Dutch population.
But the true success of Quaker colonization was Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II grant his proprietary rights to the Quaker financier William Penn.
Penn envisioned a new society across the Atlantic where Quakers and other religious minorities could live peacefully and without persecution.
In 1682, some 2,000 settlers made the trip to Pennsylvania where they founded its capital at Philadelphia, and about 6,000 more followed by 1685.
Penn was happy to grant generous parcels of lands to small holders, Quaker and non-Quaker alike, to build his society.
With an elected assembly and significant local and individual freedom, Pennsylvania was a thriving model for new world colonization, but not a perfect one.
More staunch Quakers wanted Penn to prioritize building a religious society, while Penn was still a proprietor who was always careful to ensure profits kept climbing.
This left some Quakers to leave Pennsylvania in favor of Quaker controlled New Jersey.
But Penn's work seemed to pay off anyway.
By 1700, Pennsylvania was home to 18,000 colonists, and Philadelphia was rapidly becoming one of the largest, wealthiest, and best educated cities in America.
Disruption came in 1685 when the newly crowned James II ordered the unification of New England with New York and New Jersey to create the crown controlled Dominion of New England.

# Expansion & Struggles of English Colonies
00:54:35 - 01:00:35

由此引发了社会动荡。
地方权力受到严重限制，英国国教甚至天主教的宗教活动都只能被容忍。
可惜的是，詹姆斯一世是一位不得人心的君主，在1688年的光荣起义中被和平废黜，荷兰王子威廉和他的妻子玛丽取而代之。
直到几年后，消息才传到殖民地。
效忠于詹姆斯二世的自治领政府不愿放弃权力，但纽约和马萨诸塞的叛乱迫使自治领崩溃。
然而，威廉三世国王并不急于放弃王室的控制权。
自治领被解散回各个独立的殖民地，但他向马萨诸塞州和新罕布什尔州强行任命皇家总督，以加强英国的控制，并维持一种更加宽容的宗教政策，这标志着清教徒在新英格兰统治的结束。
除此之外，还有两个英国殖民化领域值得关注。
1649年，查理一世国王被处决，英格兰落入奥利弗·克伦威尔的统治之下。
一个坚定的清教徒，对天主教徒怀有无法抑制的仇恨。
在克伦威尔统治的大部分时间里，英国都深陷与天主教西班牙的战争之中。
其主要结果是英国在 1655 年占领了牙买加，使英国控制了加勒比海地区最大、最赚钱的糖生产岛屿之一。
加上巴巴多斯和安提瓜岛、蒙塞拉岛、圣尼维斯岛等背风群岛，英国占据了有利位置，可以将加勒比地区变成糖业生产强国。
虽然北美殖民地更为人所知，但17世纪和18世纪初才是英国加勒比帝国的时代。
在接下来的几十年里，数十万吨糖从英国的加勒比殖民地横渡大西洋运回英国。
起初，契约白人是主要劳动力。
再次强调，克伦威尔在战争初期掌权具有特殊意义。
他需要一个地方安置那些被他俘虏的讨厌的爱尔兰人和苏格兰人，强迫他们跨越大西洋为他种植甘蔗，这不失为一个好办法。
但英格兰和威尔士的契约劳工也被派往了那里。
在1630 年至 1700 年间来到加勒比海的 223,000 名白人殖民者中，约有一半是契约劳工。
几乎全部用于制糖。
但不久之后，劳动力需求超过了契约劳工的供给，奴隶制开始占据主导地位。
加勒比地区是英国跨大西洋奴隶贸易的主要目的地，1642 年至 1700 年间奴隶数量急剧增长。
1672年皇家非洲公司的成立确保了奴隶顺利运往加勒比殖民地。
1645年，巴巴多斯约有5700名非洲奴隶，到1698年增至42000人；
而牙买加1656年有1410名奴隶，到1698年已超过41000人。
奴隶人口远远超过白人人口，白人依靠暴力和严苛的法律法规来维持统治，这些法律法规限制奴隶的自由，并将奴隶的地位定义为与生俱来、由肤色决定的。
与拥有众多独立土地所有者家庭和宜人城镇的新英格兰相比，加勒比殖民地的大多数人生活在少数种植园精英的奴役之下，这些精英通过奴役他人而致富。
到 1700 年，加勒比海地区的糖每年能产出约 300 万磅的价值，而这代价是约 20 万名非洲奴隶被贩运到英属加勒比海或北美港口。
种植园财富也是英国殖民扩张的另一个重要领域——卡罗来纳——的关键所在。
1663年，查理二世将卡罗来纳地区的土地授予了八位强大的地主。
第一个永久定居点于 1670 年在查尔斯顿建立。
卡罗来纳迅速发展成为一个重要的殖民地，南部拥有繁荣的奴隶种植园经济，北部则有更多独立的家庭农场社区。
业主们大多不怎么管事，他们舒舒服服地待在英国的家中，对殖民地漠不关心。
唯一的例外是什伯里伯爵，他与哲学家约翰·洛卡奇一起，试图将卡罗来纳州打造成一个完美的社会。
卡罗来纳的基本宪法试图勾勒出一个将自由和民主的自由主义思想与奴隶制和世袭贵族制度相结合的社会。
这项离奇的实验从头到尾都以失败告终。
卡罗兰人对业主试图改造社会的粗暴尝试感到不满，他们要么以抵抗回应，要么干脆完全无视这些尝试，专注于自己的农场和种植园。
不过，到 1700 年，英国王室的权力可能是自殖民开始以来在英国殖民地最强大的时期。
但美国殖民者对此感到很不自在。
几代人之后，他们中的大多数人对祖国已经没有什么忠诚可言了。
随着殖民地生活日益繁荣稳定，许多人开始觉得殖民地已经超越了英国。
一个他们几乎从未到访过的遥远国家，真的配统治他们吗？
随着18世纪的到来，这个问题只会越来越受到关注。
谈到英国人，就不能不提及法国人，法国人率先殖民了加拿大和北美内陆地区。

Local authority was severely limited and Anglican and even Catholic worship was to be tolerated.
Alas, James proved to be an unpopular monarch and was peacefully deposed in favor of the Dutch Prince William and his wife Mary during the glorious rebellion of 1688.
It took until the next few years for news to reach the colonies.
The Dominion government, loyal to James II, was reluctant to give up power, but rebellions in New York and Massachusetts forced the Dominion to collapse.
However, King William III was not so eager to let royal control slip.
The dominion was dissolved back into separate colonies, but he imposed royal governors upon Massachusetts and New Hampshire to tighten English control and maintained a more tolerant religious policy that spells the end of Puritan dominance in New England.
Beyond that, there are two other areas of English colonization worthy of attention.
In 1649, King Charles I lost his head and England passed to the control of Oliver Cromwell.
A staunch Puritan with an insatiable hatred of Catholics.
Britain spent most of Cromwell's reign locked in war with Catholic Spain.
The main result of this being the British capture of Jamaica in 1655, giving Britain control of one of the largest and most lucrative sugar producing islands in the Caribbean.
Combined with Barbados and the leeward isles like Antigua, Monserat and St.
Nevice, Britain was well positioned to turn the Caribbean into a sugar producing powerhouse.
While the North American colonies are better known, the 17th and early 18th century was really the age of Britain's Caribbean Empire.
Hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar sailed back across the Atlantic from Britain's Caribbean colonies over the following decades.
At first, indentured whites were the main labor force.
Again, Cromwell being in power at the start had special relevance.
He needed a place to put all those pesky Irish and Scots he captured, and forcing them across the Atlantic to grow sugar for him was as good a plan as any.
But English and Welsh indentures were sent as well.
Of the 223,000 white colonists who came to the Caribbean between 1630 and 1700, around half of them were indentured servants.
Almost all of them bound for sugar production.
Soon enough though, demand for labor outstripped the indentured supply and slavery came to dominate.
The Caribbean was the primary destination for slaves in Britain's transatlantic slave trading, and the numbers grew sharply between 1642 and 1700.
The founding of the Royal Africa Company in 1672 ensured the smooth transportation of slaves to the Caribbean colonies.
Barbados had around 5,700 African slaves in 1645, swelling to 42,000 by 1698, while Jamaica's 1,410 slaves in 1656 had become over 41,000 in 1698.
The slave population significantly outnumbered the white population who kept control with violence and aggressive legal codes that restricted slaves and defined their status as innate and inherent to their skin color.
In contrast to New England with its many independent landowning families and pleasant towns, the Caribbean colonies were a place where most people lived in servitude to a narrow plantation elite who'd grown rich from the enslavement of others.
By 1700, Caribbean sugar was producing some 3 million pounds of value per year at the cost of about 200,000 African slaves brought into the British Caribbean or North American ports.
Plantation wealth was also key to the other great arena of British colonial efforts, Carolina.
In 1663, Charles II granted land rights to eight powerful proprietors in the territory of Carolina.
The first permanent settlement was laid down at Charleston in 1670.
And Carolina quickly grew to be a valuable colony with a thriving slave plantation economy in the south with more independent family farming based communities in the north.
The proprietors were mostly hands-off, taking little interest in the colony from their comfy homes back in England.
The one exception was the Earl of Shsbury, who along with the philosopher John Lockach, attempted to craft Carolina into a perfect society.
The fundamental constitutions of Carolina attempted to outline a society that blended liberal ideas of freedom and democracy with slavery and hereditary nobility.
The bizarre experiment was a failure from start to finish.
Carolans resented the proprietor's outofouch attempts to remake society which they answered with resistance or just by ignoring them entirely to focus on their farms and plantations.
Still, by 1700, royal power was probably the strongest it had been in the British colonies since settlement began.
But this fact did not sit comfortably among the American colonists.
After generations, most of them had little loyalty to the mother country.
And with the soaring prosperity and stability of colonial life, many began to feel that the colonies had surpassed England.
Did a distant country few of them had ever visited really deserve to rule them?
That question would only grow louder as the 18th century dawned.

# Expansion & Struggles of French Colonies
01:00:35 - 01:04:43

1642年，法国人在蒙特利尔建立了另一个新的殖民地，进一步巩固了他们在北方的地位。
法国的主要目的是确立其对五大湖地区的影响力和安全。
但要做到这一点，就必须与当时已经存在的强大势力——伊拉克联盟——进行接触。
伊拉克利翁联盟是由五个国家组成的联盟。
在欧洲人到来之前的几个世纪，基尤加人、莫霍克人、奥尼达人、奥努达加人和塞尼卡人根据伟大的和平法联合起来，结束了该地区的战争。
伊拉克科伊人自然对新来者心存戒备，像许多美洲原住民群体一样，他们以自身利益为出发点来应对欧洲人的到来。
由于法国人对他们的祖先领土构成了更大的威胁，乌尔克沃伊人利用法国与英国和荷兰之间的竞争，与荷兰和英国商人进行贸易，换取武器，然后利用这些武器抵抗法国人对他们土地的侵略。
海狸战争持续了17世纪的大部分时间。
当法国殖民者侵占他们的领土时，伊拉克人进行了激烈的抵抗。
反过来，他们又对法国的定居点、商人和探险家发动了袭击。
其他土著群体，如休伦人，采取了不同的做法，寻求与法国结盟。
休伦人和其他几个土著群体（其中许多与伊拉克奎人有长期的敌对关系）拿起武器反抗他们。
由此引发的海狸战争，与其说是法国人与土著人民之间的战争，不如说是不同阵营的土著人民之间的冲突，甚至更为严重。
与美洲的每个角落一样，对于欧洲殖民者，并没有统一的反应，不同的群体根据自己的需要进行战斗、贸易、忽视、融合和合作。
一个世纪以来，战争时而兴盛，时而衰落。
从 1666 年起，法国和伊拉克之间开始了一段较长的和平时期，因为伊拉克人将注意力转向了其他土著群体。
但17世纪80年代战争再次爆发。
始于 1688 年的英国和法国之间的九年战争蔓延到美洲，威廉国王与英国结盟的伊拉克人以及法国结盟的休伦人开战，引发了新一轮冲突，直到1697 年才以和平告终。
到那时，乌尔科伊人控制了新英格兰边境的大部分地区和俄亥俄河谷。
除了加拿大之外，法国的主要兴趣在于密西西比河流域。
他们从 17 世纪 70 年代开始勘探该盆地，1682 年，勒内·罗伯特·卡瓦利埃·德·拉萨尔宣布整个河流系统为法国路易斯安那的领土。
路易斯安那州被阿肯色河分为上游和下游两个地区。
上路易斯安那州由密西西比河上游流域形成，包括今天的伊利诺伊州、密苏里州和印第安纳州，而南部的所有地区则属于下路易斯安那州。
17世纪末，来自加拿大的法国移民迁入该地区。
路易斯安那州北部地区拥有广袤肥沃的农田，同时也有大量的动物可供猎取毛皮或食物，这吸引了人们前来。
早期在路易斯安那州南部地区的定居十分艰难，而且并不成功。
法国第一个永久性殖民地实际上位于今天的德克萨斯州，即圣路易斯堡。
该城建于 1685 年，仅存在了 3年，就被当地土著居民征服并屠杀了。
在路易斯安那地区，小村庄和堡垒的建立取得了更大的成功，但大规模殖民化要等到 18世纪才能实现。
虽然法国人在17 世纪下半叶的日子并不好过，但至少可以说他们比西班牙人过得好。

who took the lead in colonizing Canada and the inland areas of North America.
1642 saw the French settle another new colony in Montreal, deepening their foothold in the north.
France's main concern was to establish its influence over and security in the Great Lakes region.
But doing this required engaging with the great power that was already there, the Irakcoy Confederacy.
The Irakcoy Confederacy was an alliance of five nations.
The Kyuga, the Mohawk, the Onida, the Onundaga, and the Senica, who had joined together under the great law of peace to end fighting in the region centuries before the Europeans arrived.
Naturally, the Irakcoy were wary about the newcomers, and like many Native American groups, they navigated the arrival of the Europeans with an eye to their own interests.
With the French posing a bigger threat to their ancestral territory, the Urkquoy took advantage of France's rivalry with England and the Netherlands to trade with Dutch and English merchants for weapons, which they could then use to resist French encroachment on their land.
The Beaver Wars raged for most of the 17th century.
As French settlers encroached on their territory, the Irakcoy resisted with violent force.
In turn, they launched attacks on French settlements, traders, and explorers.
Other indigenous groups like the Huron took a different approach, seeking alliances with the French.
The Huron and several other indigenous groups, many with long-standing rivalries with the Irakquoy, took up arms against them.
The resulting Beaver Wars were as much, if not more so, a conflict between differently aligned native peoples as it was a war between the French and the native peoples.
As in every corner of the Americas, there was no single unified response to European settlement, and different groups fought, traded, ignored, integrated, and cooperated as they saw fit.
Fighting rose and fell over the century.
An extended period of peace between the French and Irakcoy began from 1666 as the latter turned their attention to other native groups.
But war resumed in the 1680s.
The nine years war between Britain and France, which began in 1688, spilled over into the Americas as King Williams war with the Irakquoy allied with the British and the Huron with the French, triggering a renewed wave of conflict that only ended with peace in 1697.
By that point, the Urkoy controlled much of the New England frontier and the Ohio River Valley.
Beyond Canada, France's primary interest lay in the Mississippi River Basin.
They explored the basin from the 1670s and in 1682, Renee Robert Cavalier De Lasal declared the entire river system to be the French possession of Louisiana.
Louisiana was divided into upper and lower regions separated at the Arkansas River.
Upper Louisiana was formed from the upper Mississippi Valley, which included today's states of Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana, while everything to the south was lower Louisiana.
French settlers from Canada moved into the area in the late 17th century.
Attracted by the vast fertile farming land, the upper Louisiana region also had an abundance of animals that could be hunted for furs or food.
Early settlement in lower Louisiana was hard and unsuccessful.
The first permanent French colony was actually in modern Texas at Fort St.
Louis.
Founded in 1685, it lasted just 3 years before indigenous locals conquered it and slaughtered the population.
Small villages and forts were planted across the Louisiana territory with more success, but large-scale colonization would have to wait until the 18th century.
While the French weren't having the best time of it in the second half of the 17th century, they could at least say they were doing better than the Spanish.

# Expansion & Struggles of Spanish Colonies
01:04:43 - 01:08:26

西班牙在新大陆的经历是其在旧大陆遭遇困境的后果。
17 世纪下半叶对于西班牙王室来说是艰难的一年，这分散了他们对美洲的注意力和资源。
法国的崛起，尤其是在路易十四漫长的统治时期，以及西班牙和葡萄牙之间的伊比利亚联盟的瓦解，使西班牙王室虚弱不堪，疲惫不堪。
他们的法国、荷兰、葡萄牙和英国对手都渴望利用这一点，例如英国在 1655 年占领了牙买加。
西班牙也面临着来自美洲的诸多麻烦。
大量土著人口的减少严重限制了劳动力供应，西班牙无法强行进入大西洋奴隶贸易。
西班牙殖民地难以找到生产糖或开采使帝国如此富有的金银所需的劳动力。
他们购买的奴隶大多是通过他们的帝国竞争对手购买的。
与此同时，留守的当地居民对西班牙的统治越来越反抗。
在秘鲁，印加土著发动了数十次小规模起义，反对西班牙人的剥削行为，包括强迫他们为国家劳动，以及西班牙官员哄抬物价，强迫他们从西班牙高价渠道购买工具和物资，然后以折扣价将产品卖给西班牙人，西班牙人再从中牟利。
特定地区也带来了自身特有的问题。
由于缺乏可开发的资源或可剥削的当地劳动力，西班牙在佛罗里达的定居点发展速度放缓，导致人们对该地区的兴趣转向了英国和法国，它们进一步向南扩张。
佛罗里达与其说是一块有价值的领地，不如说是加勒比海和中美洲更有价值的殖民地的缓冲地带。
佛罗里达并没有保护加勒比海的西班牙船只免受海盗的真正祸害。
17 世纪下半叶是海盗的黄金时代，欧洲船只不断受到独立海盗或私掠船的骚扰，而这些海盗或私掠船又得到其竞争对手的支持。
英国人给驻扎在查尔斯镇（今巴哈马群岛的拿骚）的私掠船带来了特别大的麻烦。
1684年，西班牙舰队成功袭击了该镇，并将其夷为平地。
但海盗的威胁远未得到解决。
南方有印加叛军，加勒比海有海盗，到处都有欧洲列强的竞争，西班牙在其北美领土新墨西哥也面临抵抗，这恐怕不足为奇。
新墨西哥州的普韦布洛人长期以来饱受西班牙统治之苦。
1680年，他们发动了一场以其战士领袖命名的全面叛乱。
坡的叛乱导致西班牙殖民者被驱逐出新墨西哥州，数百人被杀。
这是美洲原住民抵抗运动中最成功的例子之一，但这种成功是短暂的。
波普于1688 年去世，失去了他的领导，独立意志逐渐消退。
1692年西班牙人重返此地时，他们成功地以和平的方式说服了大多数普韦布洛人再次接受西班牙的统治。
然而，西班牙人不再强迫普韦布洛人从事剥削性的恩科马制度下的强制劳动，并停止了在他们社区的传教活动，这使得普韦布洛人比大多数美洲原住民群体在殖民统治下保留了更多的独立性和文化。

Spain's experiences in the New World were downstream of their troubles in the old.
The second half of the 17th century was one of difficulty for the Spanish crown, which sapped attention and resources from the Americas.
The rising power of France, especially during the long reign of Louis I 14th and the breakdown of the Iberian Union between Spain and Portugal left the Spanish crown weak and exhausted.
Their French, Dutch, Portuguese, and English rivals were keen to capitalize on that, such as England seizing Jamaica in 1655.
Spain had plenty of trouble from the Americas, too.
Massive native depopulation had severely limited the labor supply and Spain was unable to muscle its way into the Atlantic slave trade.
Spanish colonies struggled to find the labor needed to produce sugar or mine the gold and silver which had made the empire so wealthy.
The slaves they did buy were mostly bought through their imperial rivals.
Meanwhile, the native populations who remained became increasingly resistant to Spanish rule.
In Peru, the native Inca launched dozens of small-scale rebellions against exploitative Spanish practices, including forced labor for the state and price gouging by Spanish officials, who forced them to buy tools and supplies from overpriced Spanish sources, then sell their produce to the Spanish at a discounted price, which the Spanish then sold on for a profit.
Specific areas brought their own problems, too.
Spanish settlements in Florida slowed to a trickle as a lack of exploitable resources or exploitable native labor caused interest in the region to wne with the British and French expanding even further southward.
Florida became more of a buffer for the more valuable Caribbean and Central American colonies than it was a valuable holding itself.
Not that Florida protected Spanish ships in the Caribbean from their real scourge, pirates.
The second half of the 17th century was the golden age of piracy with European ships constantly harassed by independent pirates or privateeers backed by their rivals.
The English proved especially bothersome with privateeers based out of Charles Town, modern-day Nassau in the Bahamas.
A Spanish fleet successfully raided the town and burned it to the ground in 1684.
But the pirate menace was far from solved.
With Inca rebels in the south, pirates in the Caribbean, and rival Europeans everywhere, it is probably no surprise that Spain faced resistance in its North American territory of New Mexico, too.
The Pueblo people of New Mexico had long suffered under Spanish rule.
And in 1680, they launched a fullscale rebellion named for its warrior leader.
Poe's rebellion led to the expulsion of Spanish settlers from New Mexico and the killing of several hundred of them.
It was one of the most successful examples of indigenous resistance in the Americas, but that success was short-lived.
Poppe died in 1688 and without his leadership, the will for independence faded.
When the Spanish returned in 1692, they were able to peacefully convince the majority of the Pueblo people to accept Spanish rule again.
However, the Spanish no longer subjected the Pueblo to forced labor on the exploitative Encoma system and rolled back missionary work in their communities, allowing the Pueblins to retain more of their independence and culture than most Native American groups did under colonial rule.
That leaves us with Portugal, who experienced more stable dominance in South America.

# Expansion & Struggles of Portuguese Colonies
01:08:26 - 01:11:53

它在南美洲的统治地位更为稳定。
1654 年荷兰人被驱逐，确保了葡萄牙对巴西的控制；
1668 年的里斯本条约结束了与西班牙的敌对状态，进一步巩固了葡萄牙的势力范围。
因此，葡萄牙得以自由地扩张和完善其殖民统治，并将巴西变成全球糖业生产强国和奴隶剥削中心。
葡萄牙加强了殖民地管理，设立了海外委员会来管理殖民地事务，并扩大了殖民地行政官员和被称为“Sanhores deeno”的地方精英的使用范围，以管理地方事务。
与加勒比地区一样，奴隶制是巴西发展的引擎。
到 1700 年，已有 50 万非洲奴隶被运往那里，而且这些被贩运来的奴隶中还有更多人出生后就沦为奴隶。
被带到巴西的新奴隶的预期寿命最多只有几年，而且大多数出生在那里的人都活不到 25 岁。
但与其他地方不同的是，葡萄牙政府对白人殖民者、土著居民和非洲人之间的通婚和关系更加宽容，这已经催生了一个神秘的人口群体。
巴西的种族关系将永远不同于其他欧洲殖民地。
因此，尽管巴西的糖贸易稳步增长，但17世纪50年代以后加勒比海糖业的迅速扩张削弱了葡萄牙在糖贸易中的主导地位。
然而，制糖业和奴隶制依然存在，奴隶们也必然会进行反抗。
早在公元6003年，逃亡的奴隶就聚集在帕尔马里斯。
但1654年荷兰人驱逐奴隶后，逃亡奴隶的人数激增。
到了 17 世纪 70 年代，这个由逃亡奴隶组成的群体自称为安哥拉·扬加王国。
葡萄牙人多次试图关闭这座堡垒，但由于热带地形崎岖和战士们的顽强抵抗而失败。
自封为国王的甘加·祖姆巴统领军队，管理领土内的贸易，甚至还为自己建造了一座宫殿。
1678年，葡萄牙正式承认他为合法统治者。
只要他臣服于葡萄牙当局，成为某种意义上的附庸国王。
尊巴同意了，但他的对手们并不欢迎这种让步。
他的侄子祖姆比发动了叛乱。
Gangazumba被杀后，Zumbi接替了他的位置。
在接下来的15 年里，Zumbi 顽强地捍卫Palaris 的独立性。
不过最终，在 1694 年 1 月，多明戈斯·戈尔格·韦尔沃率领的另一支葡萄牙远征军攻占了祖姆比的权力中心，并俘虏了祖姆比，祖姆比最终被斩首。
镇压帕拉雷斯对葡萄牙人来说是一件令人欣喜的事，但这提醒人们糖贸易的风险以及对奴隶的依赖。
因此，17 世纪 90 年代葡萄牙探险家在巴西米纳斯地区发现黄金，为葡萄牙进入新世纪带来了令人欣喜的新财富来源。

The expulsion of the Dutch in 1654 assured Portuguese control of Brazil, and the 1668 treaty of Lisbon further secured their sphere of influence by ending hostilities with Spain.
As a result, Portugal was free to expand and refine its colonial control and turn Brazil into the global powerhouse of sugar production and a slave exploitation.
Portugal tightened up colonial administration with an overseas council to manage colonial affairs and the expansion of the use of colonial administrators and local elites known as the Sanhores deeno to manage local affairs.
As in the Caribbean, slavery was the engine that powered Brazil.
By 1700, half a million African slaves had been shipped there, and more were born into servitude from those imported slaves.
The life expectancy of a fresh slave brought into Brazil was a few years at most, and most of those born there did not live to see 25.
But unlike elsewhere, the Portuguese state was more permissive towards intermarriage and relations between white colonists, indigenous people, and Africans, which was already giving rise to a mysticio population.
Race relations in Brazil would forever be different to those in other European colonies.
As a result, while Brazil's sugar trade grew steadily, the rapid expansion of Caribbean sugar after the 1650s ate away at Portugal's dominance of the trade.
Nevertheless, sugar and slavery continued and inevitably slaves resisted.
As early as6003, escaped slaves had been gathering at Palmarees.
But after the Dutch expulsion in 1654, the numbers of escaped slaves swelled.
By the 1670s, this community of escaped slaves was styling itself as an independent kingdom named Angola Janga.
Multiple Portuguese attempts to shut it down failed against the difficult tropical terrain and fierce resistance of the warriors.
Its self-styled King Ganga Zumba commanded soldiers, regulated trade in his territory, and even built himself a palace.
In 1678, the Portuguese officially recognized him as a legitimate ruler.
so long as he submitted to Portuguese authority, becoming a sort of client king.
Zumba agreed, but such a capitulation was not welcomed by his rivals.
His nephew Zumbi launched a revolt.
Gangazumba was killed and Zumbi took his place.
For the next 15 years, Zumbi doggedly defended Palaris's independence.
Eventually though in January 1694 another Portuguese expedition under Domingos Gorge Vervo assaulted Zumbi's seat of power had circa de Macakaco conquering it and capturing Zumbbe who was eventually beheaded.
The suppression of Palarez was a welcome development for the Portuguese but it was a reminder of the risks of the sugar trade and its dependence on slaves.
So the discovery of gold in the Miner region of Brazil by Portuguese explorers in the 1690s offered a welcome new source of wealth as Portugal entered the new century.

# 1700 - The War of Spanish Succession
01:11:53 - 01:13:08

18 世纪伊始便迎来了一个不祥之兆，当时欧洲各大国家都陷入了争夺西班牙王位的血腥冲突。
1700年11月，西班牙国王查理二世去世，给西班牙留下了分裂危机。
查理和法国支持路易十四的孙子、17 岁的安茹的菲利普继承遗产。
法国和西班牙之间如此紧密的联盟是其他欧洲列强，特别是英国、荷兰和神圣罗马帝国所无法接受的，这引发了西班牙独立战争。
大部分战斗都发生在欧洲。
但到那时，任何欧洲战争也都是殖民战争，而美洲战场则被称为安妮女王战争。
英国及其本土盟友与法国和西班牙及其本土盟友展开了激烈的战斗。
战争中最重大的进展是英国在 1710 年占领了法国的阿迪亚省，该省包括今天的加拿大新斯科舍省、新不伦瑞克省和爱德华王子岛。
战争于 1713 年以《于特尔和约》结束。

The 18th century got off to an auspicious start when every major European nation fell into a bloody conflict over the Spanish throne.
The death of Charles II of Spain in November 1700 left a secession crisis for Spain.
Charles and France backs the inheritance of 17-year-old Philip of Anju, a grandson of Louis I 14th.
Such a close union between France and Spain was unacceptable to the other European powers, especially Britain, the Dutch, and the Holy Roman Empire, triggering the war of Spanish secession.
Most of the fighting played out in Europe.
But by now any European war was also a colonial war and the American theater of conflict became known as Queen Anne's war.
The British with their native allies fought fiercely against the French and Spanish with their native allies.
The most significant developments of the war saw the British capture the French province of Aadia comprising modern-day Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island in 1710.
Fighting ended with the peace of Utre in 1713.
Phipe kept his Spanish throne, but lost a lot of his European territory.

# Conclusions of the War
01:13:08 - 01:13:47

但失去了他在欧洲的大片领土。
在美洲，这场战争产生了两个主要后果。
首先，法国将阿迪亚、纽芬兰和哈德逊湾的永久性法律移交给英国。
其次，西班牙授予英国“Asiento denigrat”称号。
《奴隶贸易条约》赋予英国向西班牙帝国出售非洲奴隶的独家权利。
西班牙保住了其美洲帝国，但这一让步使西班牙在经济的关键部分上屈辱地依赖英国。

In the Americas, the war had two major consequences.
First, the permanent French laws of Aadia, Newfoundland, and Hudson Bay to the British.
And second, the granting of the Asiento denigrat to Britain by Spain.
The Asiento granted Britain the exclusive right to sell African slaves to the Spanish Empire.
Spain kept its American empire intact, but the concession reduced Spain to humiliating dependence upon Britain for a key piece of its economy.

# 18th Cent. Spanish America
01:13:47 - 01:16:55

西班牙从西班牙独立战争中走出，虽然遭受重创，但菲利普五世的王位依然稳固。
这场战争表明，西班牙的经济和海军已经远远落后于其竞争对手。
菲利普漫长的统治时期，他致力于内部改革，以实现西班牙政府、军队和经济的现代化和进步，但他的改革成效参差不齐。
他还推动西班牙在美洲的扩张，尤其是在德克萨斯州，圣安东尼奥于1718 年在那里建立。
耶稣会士是西班牙在新世界进行帝国主义扩张的关键人物。
这个天主教修会在西班牙帝国边境的传教和教育工作中发挥了领导作用。
许多边境定居点和原住民援助社区由耶稣会士管理，他们往往是原住民与殖民势力之间的主要联系。
然而，由于天主教态度的转变以及关于耶稣会权力的争议，到 18 世纪中叶，耶稣会士在天主教欧洲失宠了。
1750 年，作为《马德里条约》的一部分，西班牙试图用巴拉圭的几个耶稣会传教区与葡萄牙交换更有价值的领土。
耶稣会士因被抛弃而愤怒，并且对当地的几内亚人有着强大的影响力，于是煽动几内亚人反抗。
在几内亚战争中，葡萄牙和西班牙联手数年镇压当地叛乱。
事后看来，他们把责任完全归咎于耶稣会士。
1767年，他们被驱逐出帝国各地，他们的财产被王室没收。
从长远来看，这将对西班牙与当地土著的关系造成灾难性后果，并会导致西班牙帝国权威的削弱，最终使当地土著获得独立。
此外，还有其他虚弱的迹象。
秘鲁的金银矿藏在18世纪中期逐渐枯竭，而这些矿藏最初使西班牙殖民统治获利颇丰。
印加土著居民也躁动不安，爆发了数十起反对西班牙统治的局部叛乱，造成了极大的焦虑和混乱。
秘鲁的财富和重要性随之下降，殖民重心转移到了其他地区。
仿佛为了证明这一点，1776 年，阿根廷、乌拉圭、巴拉圭、玻利维亚和智利的大部分领土从日渐衰落的秘鲁总督辖区中分离出来，并重组为拉普拉塔总督辖区。
西班牙也试图通过加利福尼亚来弥补其帝国衰落的局面，其第一个主要定居点分别于 1769 年在圣地亚哥、1771 年在洛杉矶和 1776 年在旧金山建立。
但西班牙人在那里的定居始终是事后考虑的结果，他们也从未发现那些日后会使该地区如此繁荣的目标。

Emerging from the war of Spanish secession, Spain had taken a beating, but Philipe V was secure on his throne.
The war had demonstrated that Spain's economy and navy had fallen far behind its rivals.
Philip's long reign was one of internal reforms to modernize and improve Spain's government, military, and economy, which he did with mixed success.
He also pushed to expand Spain's American Empire, especially into Texas, where San Antonio was founded in 1718.
Key to Spanish imperialism across the New World, were the Jesuits.
This Catholic order took the lead in missionary work and education on Spain's imperial frontier.
Many of the frontier settlements and native outreach communities were run by Jesuits and they were often the main link between native subjects and colonial powers.
However, due to changing attitudes in Catholicism and controversies about Jesuit power, the Jesuits fell out of favor with Catholic Europe by the mid 18th century.
In 1750, as part of the Treaty of Madrid, Spain tried to exchange several Jesuit mission communities in Paraguay with Portugal for more valuable territory.
The Jesuits, angry at being abandoned and with strong influence over the native Guini, incited the Guini to rebel.
The Guini wars saw Portugal and Spain team up for several years to suppress the local revolt.
And when all was said and done, they laid the blame firmly on the Jesuits.
In 1767, they were expelled from all parts of the empire and their property seized by the crown.
In the long run, this would be disastrous for Spanish native relations and would contribute to the weakening of Spanish imperial authority that would eventually allow for independence.
There were other signs of weakness, too.
The gold and silver mines of Peru, which had made Spanish colonization so profitable at first, were drying up by the mid 18th century.
The native Inca were also restless with dozens of localized rebellions against Spanish rule that caused much anxiety and disruption.
Peru's wealth and importance declined in turn and focus shifted to other areas of colonization.
As if to prove this, in 1776 the territory of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and most of Chile was split off from the declining vice royalty of Peru and reorganized into the vice royalty of Rio de la Plata.
Spain also tried to compensate for its imperial decline with California which saw its first major settlements at San Diego in 1769, Los Angeles in 1771, and San Francisco in 1776.
But Spanish settlement there was always an afterthought, and they never did discover the goals that would one day make the region so prosperous.
Things were a bit more stable for Portugal, who avoided getting embroiled in most of the colonial wars in the Americas.

# 18th Cent. Portuguese America
01:16:55 - 01:18:46

避免卷入美洲的大部分殖民战争。
它在巴西的稳固地位以及在其他地区缺乏野心，最大限度地减少了与英国、法国和西班牙的冲突。
1750 年的《马德里条约》明确承认了葡萄牙和西班牙在南美洲的利益，进一步降低了冲突的风险。
因此，与其他地方正在发生的塑造历史的事件相比，葡萄牙的殖民事务相对低调。
18 世纪初，黄金的发现引发了一场淘金热，这场淘金热主导了巴西的局势。
1729 年钻石的发现进一步巩固了人们摆脱对糖业的依赖，而糖业的中心也转移到了加勒比海地区，转而从事采矿业。
为了反映这种转变，殖民地首府于 1763 年从萨尔瓦多迁至里约热内卢，以便更靠近矿区。
这些矿场对奴隶的需求并不比种植园少。
18 世纪，巴西一直是非洲奴隶前往新世界的主要目的地，近 200 万非洲奴隶被贩运到巴西。
非洲人口的持续增长促使人们制定更严苛的种族法律，以严格界定种族等级制度。
欧洲人排在最前面，梅奇索斯人排在后面，非洲人排在后面，土著居民排在最后。
葡萄牙人试图通过 1757 年的《土著法》强行征服日益减少的土著人口，但这只会通过暴力、强迫迁徙和法律歧视进一步摧毁土著社区。
但这一时期的关键事件将来自北方。

Its secure position down in Brazil and lack of ambition elsewhere minimized conflicts with Britain, France, and Spain.
The Treaty of Madrid in 1750 firmly recognized Portuguese and Spanish interests in South America, reducing the risk of conflict even more.
As a result, Portuguese colonial affairs were relatively low-key compared to the history shaping events going on elsewhere.
The discovery of gold had triggered a gold rush in the early 18th century that dominated affairs in Brazil.
The discovery of diamonds in 1729 only reinforced the pivot away from sugar, the center of which had now shifted to the Caribbean in favor of mining.
Reflecting this shift, the colonial capital moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro in 1763 to be closer to the mining areas.
These mines had no less need for slaves than the plantations did.
Brazil continued to be the primary destination for African slaves heading to the new world with almost 2 million of them imported to Brazil over the 18th century.
This continued expansion of the African population prompted harsher racial laws to rigidly define racial hierarchy.
Europeans at the top, mechisos below, Africans below that, and the indigenous peoples last of all.
Portuguese attempts to forcibly subjugate this dwindling indigenous population as expressed through the digtorio dos indos laws of 1757 only further destroyed indigenous communities with violence, forced resettlement, and legal discrimination.
But the pivotal events of this period would come from the north.

# 18th Cent. British America
01:18:46 - 01:26:54

那么，让我们把话题转回英国人身上。
18世纪初是英国美洲帝国的黄金时代。
但导致它破裂的裂缝已经显现。
每个英国殖民地都有不同的政府体制。
每个殖民地的议会和总督（如果有的话）可以期待不同的权力和特权。
尽管英国试图通过皇家总督来加强中央集权，但实际情况阻碍了统一行政结构的建立。
例如，英国王室可以否决大多数殖民地法律，但不能否决康涅狄格州或罗德岛州的法律。
皇家总督经常与民选的殖民地议会发生冲突，因为双方都认为自己的合法性来源于不同的来源。
前者来自王室，后者来自人民。
这些不一致的管理安排令人头疼。
以英国在 1732 年于佐治亚州建立的第 13 个美洲殖民地为例。
该州最初由一个受托人委员会控制，没有州长，也没有选举产生的议会。
受托人领袖詹姆斯·奥古尔索普设想将其建成一个定居殖民地，供债务人和罪犯居住，受托人可以向他们授予小块土地。
它的地理位置也十分便利，可以作为南卡罗来纳州和西班牙佛罗里达之间的缓冲地带。
大多数定居者最终都成了普通的殖民者，而不是罪犯，但不知何故，他们并不乐意成为卡罗莱纳的人肉盾牌，而且他们还没有任何代表权。
佐治亚州的殖民者不断抱怨，并且经常违抗托管人的决定。
受托人放弃了，将殖民地移交给王室，让王室来处理这些问题。
与当地土著群体的冲突也是一个长期存在的问题。
在卡罗来纳州，与土著居民的战争，加上干旱和当地动乱，使得彻底放弃该地区的可能性大大增加。
统治阶级的地主们选择将北卡罗来纳州卖回给王室，而将南卡罗来纳州及其宝贵的种植园保留下来。
南卡罗来纳州人坚守阵地，对当地土著部落发动了战争。
在切罗基人的支持下，南卡罗来纳州人残酷镇压了亚米人、克里克人和图斯卡罗拉人，几乎将这些族群从卡罗来纳州彻底清除，但代价是白人人口减少了约 7%。
图斯切罗拉人被迫向北逃亡，在那里他们向伊拉克奎人寻求庇护，伊拉克奎人接纳他们成为其联盟中的第六个国家。
令法国人和英国人大为恼火的是，他们知道图斯切罗拉人对欧洲人毫无好感。
撇开地区性问题不谈，美洲殖民地的前景仍然非常乐观。
人口增长迅速，从 1690 年的约 21 万增长到1720 年的 44.5 万，到 1750 年达到 120 万。
这种增长主要来自自然繁衍，而不是移民。
例如，1668 年切萨皮克湾白人人口中只有 19%出生于此，而到1750 年这一比例已达到 90%。
这些不断壮大的殖民地也开始向内陆扩张，第一批欧洲定居者进入了谢农多亚山谷，并在18 世纪末和 19 世纪初为进一步向西定居打开了大门。
此外，还有像纽约、波士顿和费城这样的城市，由于周边农业繁荣，能够养活更多的人口。
到18 世纪中叶，大约 10% 的美国人是城市居民，与早期殖民时期相比，这是一个急剧的增长，而且这个数字只会继续上升。
而且，那是一种美好的生活。
当然，前提是他们是白人男性。
一般的美国白人定居者可以期望拥有比欧洲人更多的土地，缴纳比欧洲人更少的税款，并在政府事务中拥有比欧洲人更大的发言权。
欧洲城市是几个世纪以来和平演变的结果，而美国城市是现代建筑，通常按照规划建造，并融合了现代便利设施，如人行道、图书馆和大型港口，符合现代贸易国家的形象。
难怪许多美国人开始相信，殖民地的生活在许多方面都远胜于欧洲的生活。
本杰明·富兰克林肯定也持这种观点，他自豪地写道，新英格兰的每个人都在公共事务中拥有投票权，住在整洁温暖的房子里，并且有充足的优质食物和燃料。
不过，他也承认，美国人在礼仪、举止和美德方面不如他们的英国同胞。
然而，富兰克林通过在他的家乡费城创办报纸、学院和哲学社团，为解决这个问题做出了相当大的贡献。
当然，也有很多奴隶不会把美国生活描绘得如此美好。
到 1750 年，北美 13 个殖民地约有 25 万名奴隶，主要集中在卡罗来纳州、佐治亚州、马里兰州和弗吉尼亚州。
这些奴隶遭受了严重的法律歧视，几乎没有机会赎回自由。
对于普通奴隶来说，自由黑人人口少得可怜，是一个遥不可及的梦想；
而许多自由黑人也是通过参与奴隶剥削来获得地位的。
奴隶反抗现象很普遍。
奴隶们会尝试逃跑、逃避劳动，以及其他一些小规模的拒绝接受现状的行为，但大规模的奴隶起义却很少见。
一旦发生冲突，通常都很短暂，而且对所有相关人员来说都是血腥的。
1739 年的斯通诺叛乱就是一个完美的例子。
数十名奴隶，大多是安哥拉人，从南卡罗来纳州的斯托诺河出发，绝望地向西班牙佛罗里达进发，那里承诺所有逃亡的英国奴隶都将获得赦免。
逃亡的奴隶们沿途杀死了数十名白人，最终在阿迪斯托河被奴隶贩子拦截。
大多数反抗的奴隶都战斗至死。
在加勒比海地区，尤其是在牙买加，奴隶们进行了最持续有效的反抗。
在那里，逃亡奴隶在内陆地区建立了逃亡奴隶社会，抵抗英国人抓捕他们的企图。
1728 年至 1740 年间，牙买加西部的卡乔上尉和东部的南尼领导的牙买加逃亡奴隶成功地击退了英国军队，直到英国被迫承认他们名义上的独立。
英国人同意不干涉马龙人，只要马龙人停止袭击种植园或帮助奴隶逃跑。
这对逃亡奴隶来说是个好消息，但对留下的庞大奴隶群体来说意义不大。
到 1763 年，英国统治下的美洲估计有五分之一的人口是奴隶。
如果将整个美洲地区考虑在内，这个数字至少也同样高，甚至更高。
到本世纪中叶，加勒比殖民地的奴隶生产了超过 41,000 吨糖，填满了殖民统治者的口袋，而他们自己却一无所有。

So let's pivot back to the British.
The early 18th century was the golden age of Britain's American Empire.
But the cracks that would break it were already visible.
Each British colony had different government arrangements.
Each colony's assembly and governor, if they had either, could expect different powers and privileges.
While Britain tried to assert more centralized control through royal governors, realities on the ground prevented the establishment of consistent administrative structure.
For example, the crown could disallow most colonial laws, but not those of Connecticut or Rhode Island.
Royal governors regularly buted heads with the elected colonial assemblies, who each saw their legitimacy drawn from different sources.
The former from the crown, the latter from the people.
These inconsistent governing arrangements were a nuisance.
Take for example the founding of Britain's 13th American colony in Georgia in 1732.
Initially controlled by a board of trustees, the state had no single governor and no right to an elected assembly.
The leader of the trustees, James Ogulthorp, envisioned it as a settler colony for debtors and convicts who could be granted small parcels of land by the trustees.
It was also conveniently placed to act as a buffer between South Carolina and Spanish Florida.
Most settlers ended up being regular colonists, not convicts, and for some reason they weren't happy with the prospect of being human shields for Carolina on tiny portions of land with no right to representation.
The Georgia colonists complained relentlessly and frequently defied the trustees.
The trustees gave up and handed over the colony to the crown to be its problem instead.
Conflict with native groups was also a persistent problem.
In Carolina, war with indigenous peoples, coupled with drought and local unrest raised the possibility of abandoning the territory entirely.
The ruling proprietors chose to sell North Carolina back to the crown while keeping South Carolina with its valuable plantations.
The South Carolinians dug in and waged their own war against local indigenous groups.
With the support of the Cherokee, the South Carolinians brutally suppressed the Yami, the Creeks, and the Tuscarora, virtually purging Carolina of those groups, but at the cost of about 7% of the white population.
The Tuscerora were forced to flee north, where they sought sanctuary with the Irakquay, who admitted them as the sixth nation in their confederacy.
Much to the anger of the French and English who knew the Tuscerora had no love for Europeans.
Regional problems aside, the picture for the American colonies was still very positive.
The population was growing rapidly from about 210,000 in 1690 to 445,000 in 1720 and 1.2 million by 1750.
Most of this growth was natural reproduction rather than immigration.
For example, while only 19% of Chesapeake's Bay white population had been born there in 1668, it was 90% by 1750.
These growing colonies began spreading inland, too, with the first European settlers heading into Shenondoa Valley and opening the doorways for further westward settlement in the late 18th and early 19th century.
Then there were the cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, which could support even larger populations thanks to the prosperous agriculture around them.
By the mid 18th century, around 10% of Americans were city dwellers, a sharp increase from early colonial days and a number that would only keep rising.
Moreover, it was a good life.
The average white American settler could expect to own more lands than a European, pay less tax than a European, and have a greater say in government affairs than a European, as long as they were a white male, of course.
While European cities were peacemeal evolutions stretching back centuries, American cities were modern constructs often built to a plan and integrated with modern conveniences like pavements, libraries, and large ports befitting of a modern trading nation.
It is no wonder that many Americans had come to believe that life in the colonies was far superior in many measures than life in Europe.
This was certainly the opinion of Benjamin Franklin, who wrote with pride that every man in New England has a vote in public affairs, lives in a tidy, warm house, and has plenty of good food and fuel.
Still, he conceded that the Americans were lacking to their English brethren in matter of manners, etiquette, and virtue.
This however was a problem Franklin did his fair share in addressing through the foundation of newspapers, colleges and philosophical societies in his native Philadelphia.
Of course, there were plenty of slaves who would not paint such a rosy picture of American life.
By 1750, there were around 250,000 slaves in the 13 North American colonies, mostly in Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, and Virginia.
These slaves experienced harsh legal discrimination with slim prospects of ever buying their freedom.
The small free black population was a distant aspiration for the average slave and many of those free blacks secured their status through their own participation in slave exploitation.
Slave resistance was common.
Attempted escapes, work avoidance, and other small-cale refusal to accept their condition was to be expected, but largecale slave revolts were rare.
When they did happen, they were usually brief and bloody for everyone involved.
The Stoneo Rebellion of 1739 is a perfect example of this.
Several dozen slaves, mostly of Angolan origin, set out from the Stono River in South Carolina in a desperate march towards Spanish Florida, where all escaped British slaves were promised amnesty.
The escaping slaves killed several dozen whites along the way before being intercepted by slave catchers at the Adisto River.
Most of the rebel slaves went down fighting.
The most consistently effective slave resistance was found down in the Caribbean, especially in Jamaica, where escaped slaves managed to form maroon societies in the interior, which resisted British efforts to recapture them.
Between 1728 and 1740, the Jamaican maroons under Captain Kajjo in the west and Nanny in the east managed to successfully fend off British troops until the British were forced to recognize their nominal independence.
The British agreed to leave the Maroons alone so long as the Maroons stopped raiding plantations or helping slaves escape.
That was great news for the maroons, but meant little to the massive slave population who remained.
By 1763, an estimated 1 in5 people in British controlled America was enslaved.
And that number was at least as high, if not higher, when taking the Americas as a whole.
The slaves in the Caribbean colonies were producing over 41,000 tons of sugar by the middle of the century, filling the pockets of their colonial masters and leaving nothing for themselves.

# Colonial Wars
01:26:54 - 01:32:19

它可能会像欧洲的情况一样，成为冲突的根源。
例如，1731 年，一艘西班牙海岸警卫队船只在加勒比海俘虏了英国船长罗伯特·詹金斯，并割掉了他的耳朵。
受伤的船长带着腌制好的耳朵回到了议会，议会最终抓住这次袭击的机会，组建了一支舰队，驶向西班牙美洲。
詹金斯战争直到 1739 年才爆发，因为这一年更像是一个宣传口号，用来掩盖加勒比海贸易的真正问题。
然而，这波新一轮冲突造成了数万人伤亡。
这场战争中最重要的事件是1741年英国对哥伦比亚卡达赫纳的进攻。
英国军队主要由美洲殖民者组成，在这次战役中伤亡惨重，大部分士兵死于疾病或战斗。
詹金斯耳战争与另一场欧洲重大冲突——奥地利独立战争——不谋而合。
另一场混乱的遗产纠纷，几乎牵涉到所有欧洲主要强国。
这场战争在美国被称为乔治国王战争。
殖民地军队和当地盟友在战斗中再次发挥了至关重要的作用。
1745 年，一支主要由新英格兰志愿者组成的部队在路易斯堡战役中取得了英国最重要的胜利，切断了法国通往圣劳伦斯河的通道，而法国对纽约和马萨诸塞州的袭击则主要由当地盟友组成。
在詹金斯耳战争和乔治国王战争之间，马萨诸塞州多达 8% 的男性人口丧生。
战争于 1748 年结束，A/SA Chappella 的一部分领土被割让，没有发生重大的领土变更。
路易丝·布尔号被归还给法国，这激怒了为之战斗甚至牺牲的美国殖民者。
但殖民者想要什么对英国来说并不重要，英国乐于用它换取对印度马德拉斯市的控制权。
这对大英帝国来说是一笔划算的买卖，但对美国人来说却并非如此，他们发现自己的牺牲被以帝国野心的名义背叛了。
殖民地与帝国统治者之间的这种隔阂只会越来越大。
这场战争对法国来说是一个沉重的打击，法国在18世纪初拥有庞大的美洲帝国，一切皆有可能。
新法兰西从蒙特利尔一直延伸到密西西比河口，法国人不断在其广袤的土地上建立新的定居点，从1701 年的底特律到 1718 年的新奥尔良。
虽然西班牙和奥地利的分裂战争塑造了法国与欧洲列强的关系，但与原住民的关系对法国人来说同样重要。
法国人继续采取各种手段，根据自身意愿结盟、煽动、驱逐或消灭当地土著群体。
例如，1722 年，在新罕布什尔州瓦巴纳基人中工作的法国传教士塞巴斯蒂安·雷亚尔煽动他们反抗英国殖民者。
法国对 1713 年《乌得勒支和约》遗留的边界争端感到愤怒，并意识到瓦巴纳基人将成为对抗新英格兰的有力武器。
这场冲突持续了3年，夺去了数百人的生命。
在其他一些地方，法国人则遭遇了当地居民的抵抗。
例如，1729 年 11 月，密西西比州罗莎莉堡的法国殖民者遭到纳切兹人的袭击，此前双方关系已持续恶化多年。
纳切兹人杀死了所有男人，但饶恕了妇女和奴隶，然后将定居点夷为平地。
由于认为当地土著即将起义，新奥尔良的法国当局派遣士兵摧毁附近的土著村庄，尽管大多数土著村庄与袭击无关。
纳切兹人最终四散而逃，其中许多人到密西西比河下游河谷的奇克索人那里寻求庇护。
法国人继续与奇克索人、纳切兹人和其他土著群体作战，其中许多土著群体得到了英国人的支持，同时还利用他们自己的土著盟友，如查尔考人，这种情况一直持续到18 世纪 50 年代。
然而，法国在路易斯安那的殖民命运最终将由遥远的北方发生的事件决定。
1754 年 5 月 28 日，弗吉尼亚州州长派遣一位名叫乔治·华盛顿的年轻军官去将驻守在俄亥俄河源头的法国驻军赶走。
原本只是一次简单的清剿任务，却演变成一场小规模冲突，导致十几人丧生。
这次遭遇的消息传开后，英国和法国都加大了军事力度，并开始准备对对方发动远征。
华盛顿无意中引发了后来被称为法国印第安战争的冲突。
1756 年，奥地利领土争端引发了另一场欧洲大战，英国和法国只是继续着他们的冲突。

America could prove the sources of conflicts just as much as conditions back in Europe could.
For example, in 1731, a Spanish Coast Guard ship in the Caribbean captured the English captain Robert Jenkins and sliced off his ear.
The wounded captain took his pickled ear back to Parliament, who eventually seized upon the attack to assemble a fleet to sail against Spanish America.
The War of Jenkins ear did not erupt until 1739, as the year was more of a publicity slogan to mask the real concerns over trade in the Caribbean.
Still, this new wave of conflict saw tens of thousands of casualties.
The most significant episode of the war was the British attack on Kardahena in Colombia in 1741.
The British force, composed mostly of American colonists, suffered tremendous casualties in the campaign and lost most of their men to disease or combat.
The War of Jenkins Ear dovetailed into yet another major European conflict in the war of the Austrian secession.
Another chaotic inheritance dispute that managed to draw in almost every major European power.
It played out in America as King George's War.
Again, colonial troops and native allies were essential to the fighting.
It was a force of mostly New England volunteers who won Britain's most important victory at the Battle of Louisbour in 1745, cutting off French access to the St.
Lawrence River and indigenous allies made up the backbone of French raids into New York and Massachusetts.
As much as 8% of Massachusetts male population was lost between the War of Jenkins Ear and King George's War.
The war ended with a piece of A/SA Chappella in 1748 with no major territorial changes.
Louise Boore was handed back to France, much to the anger of the American colonists who had fought and died for it.
But what the colonists wanted didn't really matter to Britain, who was happy to exchange it for control of the city of Madras over in India.
A good deal for the British Empire, but not one for the Americans, who founds that their sacrifices had been betrayed in the name of imperial ambition.
This disconnect between colony and imperial master would only keep growing.
The war was a blow for France, who had opens the 18th century with a vast American empire and everything to play for.
New France stretched from Montreal to the mouth of the Mississippi, and the French consistently planted new settlements across its breadth, from Detroit in 1701 to New Orleans in 1718.
While the wars of Spanish and Austrian secession shaped relations with European powers, relations with indigenous peoples proved to be just as important for the French.
The French continued their efforts to ally, incite, remove, or destroy native groups as it saw fit.
For example, in 1722, the French missionary Sebastian Rayal, who worked among the Wabanaki of New Hampshire, incited them to rebel against British settlers.
France was angry about border disputes left over from the peace of Utrect in 1713 and realized that the Wabanaki would make a useful weapon against New England.
The conflict raged for 3 years and claimed hundreds of lives.
In other places, the French found themselves on the receiving end of native resistance.
In November of 1729, for example, French colonists at Fort Rosalie in Mississippi were attacked by the Nachez after years of declining relations.
The Nachez killed all of the men but spares the woman and slaves before burning the settlement to the ground.
Believing a native revolt was imminent, French authorities in New Orleans dispatched soldiers to destroy nearby native villages, even though most had nothing to do with the attack.
The Nachez were eventually scattered with many of them seeking shelter with the Chickasaw in the lower Mississippi Valley.
The French continued to wage war against the Chickasaw, Nachez, and other native groups, many of whom received support from the British while using their own native allies like the Chalkaw well into the 1750s.
However, the fates of French colonization in Louisiana would ultimately be decided by events far to the north.
On May 28th, 1754, the governor of Virginia dispatched a young officer named George Washington to push away a French garrison from the headarters of the Ohio River.
What was supposed to be a simple clearing mission descended into a skirmish which left a dozen men dead.
When word spread of the encounter, both Britain and France escalated their military efforts and began preparing expeditions against each other.
Washington had unintentionally triggered what would later be dubbed the French and Indian War.
When another major European war broke out in 1756 over Austrian territorial claims, Britain and France merely continued their conflict.

# The 7-year war
01:32:19 - 01:33:55

这场持续七年的战争规模更大，参战国包括英国、普鲁士和葡萄牙，以及法国、西班牙、奥地利、俄罗斯和瑞典等国。
战争自然而然地波及到了美国人，欧洲列强及其美洲盟友之间爆发了激烈的冲突。
最初，法国在北美战争中占据上风。
当时的情况非常令人担忧，以至于在1754 年 6 月，来自七个美国殖民地（纽约、宾夕法尼亚、马里兰、马萨诸塞、康涅狄格和新罕布什尔）的代表在奥尔巴尼会面，讨论他们自己的防御计划，以及如果法国入侵，他们可能与印第安人结盟。
奥尔巴尼大会是多个殖民地的代表首次自发聚集在一起，共同管理自身事务。
这虽然不是一次独立会议，但一些与会者，例如宾夕法尼亚州的本杰明·富兰克林，会在未来的岁月里记住这种殖民地合作模式的有效性。
随着战争持续到18 世纪 50 年代后期，英国的军事实力逐渐恢复。
1759 年，他们转入进攻，率领一支军队沿圣劳伦斯河逆流而上，围攻魁北克城，该城于当年 9 月陷落。
1760年，他们向西进军，从法国手中夺回了蒙特利尔的控制权。
英国在加拿大取得的胜利以及欧洲局势的发展，确保了其在1763年赢得战争的胜利。
由此签订的《巴黎条约》是法国美洲帝国的致命一击。

The wider 7 years war pitted Britain, Prussia and Portugal against France, Spain, Austria, Russia and Sweden among others.
And naturally the war came to the Americans with the European powers and their native allies trading blows.
Initially France got the better of the fighting in North America.
The situation was so concerning that in June 1754, representatives from seven American colonies, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire met at Albany to discuss plans for their own defense and possible alliances with the Indians should France invade.
The Albany Congress was the first time that representatives of multiple colonies had gathered together of their own initiative to direct their own affairs.
This was no independence meeting, but some of its attendees, like Pennsylvania's Benjamin Franklin, would remember how effective such a model of colonial cooperation was in years to come.
Britain's military fortunes recovered as the war continued through the late 1750s.
In 1759, they went on the offensive, sailing an army up the St.
Lawrence River and laying siege to Quebec City, which fell in September that year.
In 1760, they marched west and rested control of Montreal from France as well.
Britain's gains in Canada and events back in Europe secured its victory in the war by 1763.
The resulting treaty of Paris was the deathnell for France's American Empire.

# Fall of New France
01:33:55 - 01:34:35

英国将保留法国在加拿大的所有旧领土及其10万居民。
与此同时，法属路易斯安那州被分裂了。
密西西比河以西的所有土地都归西班牙所有，而密西西比河以东的所有土地，包括西班牙佛罗里达，都归英国所有。
除了少数几个小岛之外，法国的美洲帝国就此终结。
然而，英国并没有太多时间来庆祝这场胜利，它也将面临殖民崩溃。

Britain would keep all of France's old Canadian territory and its 100,000 inhabitants.
Meanwhile, French Louisiana was split.
Everything west of the Mississippi went to Spain, while everything east went to Britain, including Spanish Florida.
Aside from a handful of small islands, France's American Empire, was over.
However, Britain would not have too long to celebrate this victory before it too faced colonial collapse.
Britain's victory in the 7 Years War was expensive in both money and manpower.

# Road to American Revolution
01:34:35 - 01:40:59

无论在金钱还是人力方面，都付出了惨重的代价。
战争债务高达 1.61 亿英镑，而美洲的大部分战斗都是由感到不受英国王室赏识的美国殖民者进行的。
英国现在也面临着管理不断扩张的美国帝国的成本和挑战。
除了要应对不满的被占领的法国人口外，许多人还会从阿卡迪亚被驱逐到路易斯安那，在那里他们成为了辛琼人。
英国还不得不应对新一轮的本土抵抗运动。
1760 年代与卡罗来纳州切罗基人的冲突，以及1763 年的大北方印第安人起义（当时多个土著群体联合起来反对英国的新统治），都证明英国仍然迫切需要资金和人力来巩固其帝国。
乔治三世国王认为，美洲殖民地应该为此支付他们应尽的份额。
1764 年的《糖税法》标志着为实现这一目标而对美国殖民者征收的一系列税收和关税中的第一项。
然而，英国低估了殖民地的信心和抵抗力量。
即使违背殖民者的意愿强加一项相对较小的税收，也会引发殖民者意想不到的强烈抵抗。
他们反对议会强加给他们的税收，因为他们在议会中没有代表。
英国无视最初的反对意见，继续推行1765年的印花税法案和1767年的城镇税，对各种商品征税。
总的来说，新税收其实并不算多。
与当时的欧洲几乎所有人相比，典型的美国殖民者缴纳的税款更少，受到的政府管制也更少。
然而，一种桀骜不驯的殖民精神已经出现。
许多殖民者富裕、稳定、自信，他们觉得自己已经超越了英国，并对宗主国强加给他们的任何事情感到不满。
抗议活动愈演愈烈，英国被迫向美国城市派遣军队维持秩序。
1770 年 3 月 5 日，这一决定在波士顿酿成悲剧，英国军队向手无寸铁的抗议者开火，造成五人死亡。
不满情绪逐渐转化为愤怒。
1773 年的《茶叶法》旨在限制走私茶叶的贸易，并增加陷入困境的东印度公司的收入。
相反，它说服了波士顿的反英领导人登上公司船只，将 10,000 磅茶叶倾倒入波士顿港。
作为回应，英国关闭了所有港口。
这显然激怒了所有依赖贸易的人，并加剧了反英情绪。
到那时，整个殖民地的议会和精英们都在呼吁支持波士顿，要求全面起义的呼声越来越高。
到1774 年，以1754 年奥尔巴尼会议为蓝本的大陆会议将13 个美洲殖民地中的 12 个聚集在一起，要求抵制所有英国商品。
美国人所称的“不可容忍法案”是限制殖民地自由的更严格的法律的实施，这成为了压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。
谈判和和平抗议都失败了，民兵组织是美国唯一的选择。
1775年4月，英国军队在列克星顿和康科德战役中与美国叛军交战。
美国独立战争的第一场战役以英国人的胜利告终，6 月份在邦克山举行的第二场战役也以英国人的胜利告终。
但英国的胜利似乎只会让殖民地居民更加团结起来反对它。
美国人曾试图煽动加拿大加入叛乱，但以失败告终。
1775 年12 月，他们在魁北克远征中损失了 500 人，这是一场灾难性的失败。
但这并没有阻止其他美洲殖民地的反抗。
1776年7月4日，大陆会议发表了《独立宣言》，开启了美国历史的新纪元。
美国直到 1783 年才通过武力夺取独立。
但它会将1776年视为这个国家的诞生之年。
到 1776 年，美洲的殖民化催生了一个新国家，这个国家将塑造世界历史。
美国的独立预示着大多数欧洲殖民强国的崩溃。
在接下来的几十年里，美洲大部分地区摆脱了欧洲殖民统治，开启了美国独立的新时代。
1492年至1776年间，美洲发生了变化。
冲突和斗争进一步加剧。
地图被重新绘制了。
新城市崛起。
于是，新的身份开始慢慢形成。
庞大的贸易、文化和权力网络跨越重洋。
欧洲帝国扩张的同时，美洲原住民部落却日渐衰落。
18 世纪末，美洲对欧洲来说不再是神秘之地，而是他们争夺、战斗和竞争的土地。
而事情的发生方式，为新的开始奠定了基础。

War debt sat at 161 million pounds and much of the fighting in America had been done by American colonists who felt unappreciated by the crown.
Britain also now faced the cost and challenge of managing an expanded American empire.
As well as dealing with an unhappily occupied French population, many would be deported from Acadia to Louisiana where they became the Cinjun.
Britain also had to deal with a new waves of native resistance.
conflict with the Cherokee in Carolina in the 1760s and the Great Northern Indian uprising in 1763, which saw a coalition of native groups come together to oppose Britain's new dominance, proved that Britain was still in desperate need of money and manpower to secure its empire.
King George III felt that the American colonies should pay their fair share for this.
The Sugar Act of 1764 marked the first of a series of taxes and duties imposed upon the American colonists to meet this goal.
However, Britain had underestimated the confidence and resistance of the colonies.
The imposition of even a relatively small tax against their wishes triggered unexpectedly intense resistance from the colonists.
They objected to the taxes being imposed upon them by parliament which they had no representation in.
Britain ignored the initial objections and pressed on with the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townzang duties of 1767 imposed upon a variety of goods.
Altogether, the new taxes weren't actually all that much.
The typical American colonist was still taxed less and experienced less government control than virtually anyone in Europe at that time.
However, a fiercely independent colonial spirit had emerged.
Wealthy, stable, and confident, many of the colonists felt that they had surpassed Britain and resented the mother country imposing anything on them.
Protests mounted and Britain was forced to send troops into American cities to keep order.
On March 5th, 1770, this decision turns to tragedy in Boston when British troops opened fire on unarmed protesters, killing five people.
Discontent was now turning to anger.
The Tea Act of 1773 was designed to limit the trade of smuggled tea and boost revenue for the struggling East India Company.
Instead, it convinced anti-British leaders in Boston to march aboard company ships and dump 10,000 lbs of tea into Boston Harbor.
In response, Britain closed down all the ports.
This had the obvious effect of angering anyone dependent upon trade and fueled anti-British feeling.
By now, assemblies and elites across the colony were urging support for Boston, and calls for full-blown revolt were mounting.
By 1774, a Continental Congress modeled after the Albany Conference of 1754 brought 12 of the 13 American colonies together to demand a boycott of all British goods.
The imposition of more strict laws curtailing colonial freedom, known to the Americans as the intolerable acts, was the breaking point.
Negotiation and peaceful protest had failed, and the militias were America's only alternative.
In April 1775, British troops met American rebels at the battles of Lexington and Concord.
The first engagement of the Revolutionary War went in favor of the British, as did the second at Bunker Hill in June.
But Britain's victories only seems to unify the colonists against it.
The Americans tried and failed to incite Canada to join the rebellion, losing 500 men to a disastrous Quebec expedition in December of 1775.
But that did not deter the rest of the American colonies.
On July 4th, 1776, the Continental Congress issued their Declaration of Independence, ushering in a new age of American history.
It would take until 1783 for the United States to secure this independence through force of arms.
But it would look back at 1776 as the moment the country was born.
By 1776, the colonization of the Americas had resulted in the birth of a new nation that would go on to shape world history.
The independence of the United States foreshadowed the collapse of most European colonial powers.
Over the next few decades, most of the rest of the Americas would throw off European colonial rule and usher in a new age of American independence.
Between 1492 and 1776, the Americas changed.
More conflict and struggles emerged.
Maps were redrawn.
New cities rose.
And slowly, new identities began to take shape.
Huge networks of trade, culture, and power stretched across oceans.
European empires expanded while Native American tribes shrunk.
At the end of the 18th century, the Americas were no longer a mystery to Europe, but a land they claimed, fought, and competed over.
And the way it happened set the stage for new beginnings.
