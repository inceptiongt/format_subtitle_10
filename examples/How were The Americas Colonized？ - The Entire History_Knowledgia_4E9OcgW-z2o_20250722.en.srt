1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,380
Why did the Europeans colonize the Americas?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,088
What drove Europe's powers to cross a vast ocean, carve out new territories

3
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:15,481
and compete until nearly the entire continent was claimed?

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,315
Why did each empire focus on certain regions?

5
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:23,342
And how did so few take so much so fast?

6
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:33,378
To understand the entire story of the colonization of the Americas from the first Spanish ship landing in the Caribbeans to the late 18th century

7
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,399
we have to go back to the very beginning.

8
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:48,376
In the late 15th century, an ambitious sailor approached the king of Portugal with an impassioned offer to find new lands and riches to the west.

9
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:54,480
His proposal was dismissed as being far too fanciful and way too costly.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,000
Undeterred, this determined sailor, a man by the name of Christopher Columbus

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,960
tried his luck with Spain.

12
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,603
It was 1492, and his timing couldn't have been better.

13
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:17,052
The Spanish had just seen off the last of the daunting occupying Muslim forces and were now keen to expand in their own name.

14
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:22,421
There was money in the coffers, and Spain liked Columbus' confidence.

15
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:26,479
Columbus set sail across the Atlantic in August 1492.

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,744
Just 2 months later, he landed in the Bahamas, making the first significant European contact with the Americas.

17
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:39,759
The world was about to change forever.

18
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:49,412
Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas signaled the start of the European colonization of the American lands.

19
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:55,475
It gave birth to new nations and made some European powers incredibly rich.

20
00:01:55,475 --> 00:02:02,786
It also took a devastating toll on the native populations from which they never recovered.

21
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:12,215
All of this from what was intended to be a search for another passage to the Far East or the Indies as the East was simply known.

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,360
What led to this huge push for European expansion?

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,585
And how were the first 100 years in the Americas?

24
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:27,040
To begin, it helps to understand why the European powers were compelled to seek routes to the west.

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,663
For centuries, Europe had been dependent on the Silk Road for trade with the East.

26
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:38,736
The Silk Road enabled trade between European countries, India, and China.

27
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:49,440
Everything from tea, silk, spices, cotton, ivory, and precious metals were traded until the Ottoman Empire put a stop to it all.

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:03:01,922
When the Ottomans claimed Constantinople in 1453, today's Istanbul, it meant they effectively controlled the western end of the Silk Road.

29
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:06,928
This meant big tax hikes on anything that was traded along the famous route

30
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:12,147
and this more or less forced Europe to look for alternate routes to the east.

31
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:21,360
At the time, the Portuguese were world leaders in sea navigation and favored sending ships around Africa into the Indian Ocean.

32
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:29,360
This was their plan until a fellow named Christopher Columbus walked onto a beach in the Bahamas archipelago.

33
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:33,200
Suddenly, there was another option.

34
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,541
In 1493, Columbus made his second voyage to the Americas

35
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,642
but this time it was far more purposeful.

36
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:48,364
On his first voyage, Columbus had set out with just three ships.

37
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:52,826
The second time around comprised a fleet of 17 ships

38
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:56,674
which included colonists, priests, and soldiers.

39
00:03:56,674 --> 00:04:03,331
They even took a pack of fearsome looking mastiff dogs to further intimidate the natives.

40
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:07,994
Not that Columbus was particularly concerned about any native resistance.

41
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:19,246
However, in a revealing extract from his 1492 diary, Columbus wrote that the Caribbean people should be good servants and would easily be made into Christians.

42
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:27,338
He also noted that the natives seemed to be unarmed or were at least unfamiliar with iron weapons such as swords.

43
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:36,080
This was immensely encouraging to the powers back in Spain and Columbus was sent again in 1493 to set up a colony.

44
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,275
History was made when Sto Domingo became the first official European settlement in the Americas.

45
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:49,343
The colony was established on the Caribbean island of Hispanola

46
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:53,280
which is today split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

47
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,800
When word filtered back to Europe that there was a mass of land to the west

48
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,600
the Portuguese wanted in on the action.

49
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:15,543
Spain, of course, was only too aware of Portugal's naval strength and realized the Portuguese could prove a real obstacle to further expansion in the new world.

50
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:22,960
And so, in 1494, Pope Alexander V 6th stepped in to avoid future conflicts.

51
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,425
A demarcation line was drawn up in the Atlantic Ocean running north to south.

52
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:36,823
Anything lying to the west of the line was to be Spain's and any territory to the east were fair game for Portugal.

53
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:40,400
Both countries agreed and signed the treaty of Torisilas.

54
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,720
The demarcation line was situated roughly in the middle of the Atlantic

55
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,880
about 2,000 km west of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa.

56
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,652
The general idea was that the new lands discovered by Columbus would go to Spain

57
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:02,984
while Portugal was free to conquer Africa and southern Asia.

58
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:08,964
There was just a small exception to what was pretty much all Spanish territory.

59
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:16,823
A sizable chunk of land in South America was jutting out into Portugal's side of the demarcation line.

60
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,840
In 1500, this was unknown to the Portuguese.

61
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,784
[Music] In 1498, Vasco Dama had successfully rounded Africa to reach India

62
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:32,921
becoming the first European to reach India by sea.

63
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:41,280
Portugal was excited because access to India via the Mediterranean was blocked by Italian and Ottoman fleets.

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
A second voyage was organized, this time with Pedro Alvarez Cabral in charge.

65
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:53,454
Cabral commanded 13 ships which held over 1,000 men and supplies.

66
00:06:53,454 --> 00:07:02,964
Like Dama, he sailed down the African West Coast and then headed out into the western Atlantic to ride on the back of the trade winds.

67
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,109
Unlike Dama, though, Cabral continued heading west.

68
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:13,382
And in April 1500, he landed on the northeastern shores of Brazil at Bajia.

69
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:18,966
Realizing that this new land lay on Portugal's side of the demarcation line

70
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,599
Cabral claimed it on behalf of the crown.

71
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,345
Although many historians have speculated that other Europeans had most likely been there before Cabral

72
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:36,251
he is generally acknowledged to be the one who officially discovered Brazil.

73
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:42,077
Cabral looked around Bajia and guessed that it was in fact part of a continent.

74
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,974
He sent a ship back to Lisbon immediately to spread the good news.

75
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:52,097
The Portuguese were eager to get their hands on any precious metals that might have been in Brazil.

76
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,560
specifically gold and silver.

77
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,511
When it became clear that the local timber was the only real resource of any value

78
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,861
the Portuguese lost interest in Brazil for the next few decades.

79
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:12,010
The local trees called Brazilwood were found to be useful because of the red dye that could be extracted.

80
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,799
This was used to make textiles and clothes back in Europe.

81
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:19,758
And the Portuguese had the natives clear the forests for them.

82
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:26,080
They traded items such as mirrors, scissors, knives, and axes with the natives to seal the deal.

83
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:39,015
Almost from the start, the Portuguese relationship with the indigenous people was markedly different from that between the Spanish and the natives in Mexico and Central America.

84
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:44,077
While the Spanish colonization was based more on out-and-out conquest

85
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:47,200
there was no evidence of natural riches in Brazil.

86
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,720
Instead of settling the new territory, Portugal initially decided to keep it as a trading base between Europe and India.

87
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,635
Eventually though, it was decided that the best way to manage Brazil was by forming a colony.

88
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:09,920
And in 1532, the first Portuguese settlement was established in Sao Vicente on the mid coast near today's Sao Paulo.

89
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:19,826
The new land was divided up into 15 captaincies which were areas of land granted to people for agriculture.

90
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,821
The captaincy owners were nobles, merchants or ex-sailors.

91
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:28,399
And it was soon evident that sugar was the go-to crop to grow.

92
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,567
Things began to move slowly but in the right direction.

93
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:38,480
And in 1549, Brazil was declared an official crown colony.

94
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,519
The port colony Salvador Debahajia became the capital complete with a cathedral

95
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,480
hospital, prison, and a customs house.

96
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:55,489
In the meantime, Spain had launched into a period of rapid colonization in Central and South America.

97
00:09:55,489 --> 00:10:01,279
Following on from settling in Hispanola, the Spanish then colonized Puerto Rico in 1508

98
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,600
Jamaica in 1509, and then Cuba in 1511.

99
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:20,507
In 1513, Vasco de Balboa became the first European to officially set sight on the Pacific Ocean when he crossed the ismas of Panama and declared the Pacific as a Spanish territory.

100
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:25,360
And then in 1519, things really took off for Spain.

101
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:34,926
Hernand Cortez was an explorer stationed in Cuba and eager to discover new lands and treasures for the crown.

102
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:42,125
Like others, he'd heard the rumors of the gold and silver that was waiting to be discovered over on the mainland

103
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,640
Mexico.

104
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,880
He set off on an unauthorized expedition for what was then Meso America

105
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,160
landing on the shores of Yucatan in February 1519.

106
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,707
The first indigenous people Cortez interacted with were from the Mayan tribes.

107
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:03,161
But he soon realized that in order to gain full control of Mexico

108
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,160
he had to overpower these mighty Aztecs.

109
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,279
The Aztecs were the most advanced civilization in the region at the time and were based out of their capital

110
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,439
Tenno Titlan, which would later become Mexico City.

111
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,843
However, the Spanish liked their chances.

112
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:28,660
They had superior firepower with steel swords and guns, plus well-organized armies with horses and dogs.

113
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,392
The Spanish also had arguably the European's deadliest weapon against native forces

114
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,000
diseases.

115
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,253
Smallox, in particular, was a mass killer.

116
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:46,941
None of the native tribes in the Americas had been exposed to the disease and had zero immunity.

117
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:54,187
It didn't take long for smallpox to exact a crushing toll on the Aztecs and aided by their superior weapons

118
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,440
the Spanish took control of Tennos Titlan in 1521.

119
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,715
The Aztecs hadn't gone down without a fight, however, and had battled fiercely to the end.

120
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:12,632
But they were simply too decimated and ultimately overwhelmed by sickness and Spain's artillery.

121
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:22,135
It was estimated that the Aztecs lost over 240,000 soldiers during the fighting with more than half that number falling to disease.

122
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:31,920
Most of Mexico would fall over the next few years and the Spanish then set their sights further south to the Inca controlled regions of Peru.

123
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,789
This was no easy feat.

124
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:39,760
In 1528, the Inca Empire was at the height of its powers.

125
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,959
Its territory covered a gigantic 1,800,000 square kilometers.

126
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:58,441
In 1532, Francisco Pizarro led Spanish forces into Peru, where they clashed with the Inca army in a fight to control Peru and its surrounding territories.

127
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:12,143
Despite being vastly outnumbered, Pizarro and his troops took full advantage of their superior firepower had massacred thousands of Incas who had no reply to the guns and swords of the European invaders.

128
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:18,320
The Spanish were further aided by the aftermath of a civil war that had erupted amongst the Inca leaders

129
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,200
leaving the Incan armies disorganized and unprepared for the onslaught.

130
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:32,959
Emperor Atawalpa was defeated and Spain had captured not just Peru but all of the Incan territories surrounding it.

131
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:46,560
This included almost all of South America with the exception of the Portuguesecontrolled Brazil and Venezuela.

132
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:52,374
Spain had been in Argentina in 1516 but was underwhelmed by the lack of resources and didn't officially settle there until 1580.

133
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:57,280
In 1537, Spanish troops marched into Colombia and took over Chile.

134
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,446
In 1841, Spain additionally began making inroads into North America.

135
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,908
In 1559, Tristan Duna E.

136
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:11,168
Arilano established a settlement in today's Pensacola in Florida.

137
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:15,360
Then in 1565, the Spanish set up a colony in St.

138
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,610
Augustine, Florida, not far from modern-day Jacksonville.

139
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:27,285
Throughout the 16th century, the Spanish gradually moved into areas of what would become the southern United States.

140
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:38,000
This included Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and Arizona, meaning that Spain had secured huge expanses of land across two continents.

141
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,502
None of this activity had escaped the attention of Britain and France.

142
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:54,952
The two European superpowers also knew about Spain and Portugal's Treaty of Tortoisilius and decided to completely disregard it.

143
00:14:54,952 --> 00:15:04,786
After all, neither nation answered to the Pope and both firmly believed that they had every right to acquire what they could in the new world.

144
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:09,237
France was the first to set up a serious quest.

145
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:17,729
In 1534, Francis I sent Jacques Cartier across the Atlantic on the first of his three voyages to North America.

146
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:22,240
Cartier explored the coast of New Foundland and traveled along the St.

147
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,920
Lawrence River.

148
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,165
In July of 1534, France became the third European country to officially land in the Americas.

149
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:37,413
Cartier landed on the shores of the Gas Peninsula in Quebec and placed a cross in the sand

150
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,680
claiming the land for the French crown.

151
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,036
It was to be a short-lived attempt to build New France.

152
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:51,578
Cartier also tried to establish a colony in what would become Quebec City in 1541

153
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:57,824
but the project failed due to hostilities from native tribes and atrocious weather.

154
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:08,240
The French then attempted to start colonies further down the North American coast at Paris Island in South Carolina in 1562 and then in present-day Jacksonville

155
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,000
Florida in 1564.

156
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:20,320
These efforts were thwarted by Spanish attacks who had grown increasingly paranoid about the impending French colonization of North America.

157
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:30,489
France made a half-hearted attempt to start a colony of convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598

158
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,481
but nothing materialized.

159
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:42,019
The early attempts by the French were poorly financed and didn't receive anywhere near the amount of support needed to successfully establish colonies.

160
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:50,480
That added to constant fighting with the local tribes and harsh weather meant France had little to show for its efforts by the end of the 16th century.

161
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:59,519
Big changes were taking place in England, contrarily, and it too was about to throw its hat into the ring.

162
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,721
England already had a strong and established navy and was looking to build some serious wealth.

163
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:12,400
When Queen Elizabeth took the throne in 1558, she was ready for action.

164
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:22,792
Elizabeth not only gave the green light for British ships to attack and loot any Spanish ships traveling back from the Americas with booty

165
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,618
but she also sponsored voyages to the Caribbean.

166
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:31,015
When these ventures failed because of strong reprisals from the Spanish

167
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:35,840
Elizabeth and Britain then focused their sights on the North American coast.

168
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,720
The adventurous swashbuckler Walter Raleigh was given a charter to explore North America in 1584.

169
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,587
The motives for giving Raleigh the go-ahad were both economical and ideological.

170
00:17:51,587 --> 00:18:02,120
Elizabeth realized the enormous potential that lay in colonizing parts of North America and was also keen to counter Spanish Catholicism in the region.

171
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,400
In 1585, Raleigh set up an expedition to settle at Rowanoke Island off North Carolina.

172
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:15,679
The Rowanoke colony struggled from the outset, and when a supply ship returned from England after 2 years

173
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,931
the settlement had been abandoned.

174
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,673
The mystery of Rowanoke still puzzles historians today.

175
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,559
Some believe the colonists joined the local natives.

176
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,200
Others believe the settlers simply perished.

177
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:36,705
However, Britain was far from discouraged and began making plans for another expedition to the American East Coast.

178
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:44,400
Throughout the early years of European colonization, the interaction with native populations varied widely.

179
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:53,024
Some settlers were able to establish relatively friendly relationships while other situations were heated from the start.

180
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:58,638
On the whole, the Europeans assumed themselves to be the superior race

181
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,810
and their role was to civilize and educate the natives.

182
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:09,371
The Spanish were quick to enslave the local population when they settled in Hispanola in the Caribbean.

183
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:12,320
They continued this practice when they ventured into Mexico.

184
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,482
Natives captured in battle were soon put to work and when disease began to take its toll on the local populations.

185
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:23,015
The Spanish looked to West Africa.

186
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,465
The British had a similar viewpoint.

187
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:28,784
They were there to colonize and take what they needed.

188
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:31,840
If the natives didn't like it, that was their problem.

189
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:38,246
This led to regular outbreaks of violence in the early days of colonization.

190
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:42,958
While the French later demonstrated the benefits of befriending local populations

191
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:47,840
the British, Spanish, and Portuguese were primarily concerned with conquest.

192
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,450
This meant the exchanges between the colonizers and the natives were often brutal.

193
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,330
The colonists had the technological advantage in terms of weapons

194
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,218
and the natives had an edge in using the environment that they knew so well.

195
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:10,765
Religion also played another major role in South and North America.

196
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:18,539
The natives were expected to conform to Christianity and missionaries were deployed to convert the indigenous people.

197
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:27,077
It didn't occur to many Europeans that the native people may have had existing cultures and religious beliefs of their own.

198
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:35,958
Some of the Spanish missionaries were able to spend more time with the natives than others and came to sympathize with them and understand their cause.

199
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:44,850
Pope Paul III read the letters of the missionaries and warned colonists that the native people were not beasts to be killed or enslaved

200
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,908
but human beings with souls capable of salvation.

201
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:52,269
This was quite an enlightened outlook for the time.

202
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,112
And although it conceded that Christianity was the only true way forward

203
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:02,480
the Pope indicated that colonists should at least be mindful of the plight of the natives.

204
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,519
Still, the physical shock alone must have been tremendous.

205
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:15,401
Neither side had seen anything quite like the other, and the first contacts evoked a mass array of emotions

206
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:19,857
ranging from mild curiosity to derision and fear.

207
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:25,108
Some settlers realized that befriending natives would work in their favor.

208
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:30,240
The locals knew the land better than them and they could learn how to farm it and hunt on it.

209
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,779
When the British initially settled at Rowanoke in 1585, they struck up a relationship with the local Algangquin people.

210
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,960
The Algangquin showed them how to crop the land and where to find food.

211
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:55,760
So good was this relationship that many believe the struggling settlers may have simply opted to live with the Alangquins.

212
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,760
All of this aside, no matter what industry their colonies were based on

213
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,720
all the European powers needed labor.

214
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:07,733
And when the job proved to be too much for the settlers and disease wiped out the enslaved natives

215
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:12,684
the colonists began bringing slaves over from West Africa.

216
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:18,084
And so after the first 100 years of American colonization

217
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:23,164
Spain was the clear winner in terms of territories and riches gained.

218
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:28,880
The Spanish had established colonies from Buenos Aries all the way up to Florida and Texas.

219
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:37,232
However, France was about to have a massive influence and England had only gotten started.

220
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:43,318
In North America, at least, massive changes were on the near horizon.

221
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:51,131
At the close of the 16th century, the European colonization of the Americas was well and truly underway.

222
00:22:51,131 --> 00:23:01,378
Spain had emerged as the region's superpower, conquering almost all of South America and making snaking inroads into the promising North America.

223
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:10,920
The Treaty of Tortois of 1494 declares that all territories to the west of the demarcation line belongs to Spain.

224
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:19,733
In theory anyway, England, France, and the Netherlands had simply laughed this off and went ahead with their plans

225
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:24,685
shaking their heads at Spain and Portugal's naive arrogance.

226
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:29,962
In 1592, the American colonies looked something like this.

227
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:35,280
Portugal had colonized Brazil with settlements scattered up and down the eastern coast.

228
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:44,173
The capital was Salvador in the northeastern region of Bajia where Portugal's Pedro Cabral had first claimed Brazil in 1500.

229
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,720
Spain had the most to show for its efforts with territories throughout the Caribbean

230
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,855
Mexico, Central America, and the bulk of South America.

231
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:58,080
For Spain, it was all about the gold and silver.

232
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:10,880
The mines in the new world were producing more wealth for Spain than anything the Portuguese had ever been able to extract from Africa.

233
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:13,555
In 1585, the British had attempted an early colony at Rowanoke in North Carolina

234
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:16,012
but the venture was a disaster.

235
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:25,475
However, Britain was just getting started, and plans were being laid to return to North America wiser and more determined.

236
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:30,356
France had also delved into Canada and up and down the east coast.

237
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:38,989
Although no official settlements had been established, it seemed only a matter of time before a full fleet of colonists would be dispatched.

238
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:47,545
Similarly, the Dutch were primes to send their own opportunities to exploit trade and settlement opportunities in the new world.

239
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:52,036
From the turn of the century, the action really heated up.

240
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:57,320
Things had started badly for the British with the abandoned colony at Rowanoke.

241
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,904
But far from discouraged, Britain simply decided to colonize further up the American coast in Virginia.

242
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:10,189
First, the British decided they needed to improve the financing of their missions.

243
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:13,562
This led to the creation of joint stock companies.

244
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:24,066
These stock companies functioned much like major corporations of today where investors bought shares in a trading company and received a portion of the profits.

245
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:29,541
The stock companies were able to drum up much more money than the English monarchy could.

246
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:36,156
And in6006, the Virginia Company sent a fleet of colonists and soldiers to the east coast.

247
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:43,811
Virginia was named after Queen Elizabeth, who was known as the Virgin Queen because she never married.

248
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:52,116
In6007, the first British settlement was established in America in James Town on the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia

249
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,080
named after King James I.

250
00:25:55,269 --> 00:26:04,615
Further up the eastern coast, France struggled to establish lasting colonies as harsh conditions and rival powers doomed several early efforts.

251
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:10,279
In6008, Samuel de Chaplain founded the first lasting settlement at Quebec

252
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,824
which was mainly set up to act as a fur trading post.

253
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:18,000
From here, fur traders began setting up operations along the St.

254
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,230
Lawrence River and forming relations with the local people such as the Algangquin and Abnaki tribes.

255
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,007
The region along the St.

256
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:30,142
Lawrence River came to be known as New France or Canada.

257
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:38,880
The latter coming from the native Irakcoyan word canata meaning village or settlement.

258
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:42,830
Trade for furs really took off and the French were dependent on the native smooth skills with skinning animal hides.

259
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,279
Trading relations were gradually formed albeit with occasional disputes.

260
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:56,829
Not to be left out, in6009 Dutch merchants hired the English captain Henry Hudson to make the trek across the Atlantic.

261
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:02,180
The Dutch originally wanted Hudson to navigate a way through the Northwest Passage

262
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,004
hoping to find a route connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.

263
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:11,840
Hudson found his way to the Hudson River and claimed the bay at the mouth of the river for the Netherlands.

264
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:20,131
The Dutch plan was to make this colony a trading center instead of the agricultural model favored by the British.

265
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:27,872
The Dutch West India Company was set up in 1621 with the main focus being on the lucrative fur trade.

266
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:36,471
In 1624, Dutch settlers came over and founded New Amsterdam there on the tip of today's Manhattan Island.

267
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:43,913
The city became a thriving trade port with the Native Americans only too happy to trade fur in return for firearms

268
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:47,160
wool blankets, and metal tools.

269
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,760
Life was tough from the get-go for the colonists.

270
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,479
Many were from privileged families back home or were artisans and craftsmen.

271
00:27:55,479 --> 00:28:01,337
Few of them were used to the hard physical labor that was required to get the colony up and running.

272
00:28:01,337 --> 00:28:06,309
Added to this was unforgiving weather, ongoing battles with native tribes

273
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,080
and periods of starvation, which eventually drove some to cannibalism.

274
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:17,932
Many of the James Town settlers had come to America expecting to get rich by discovering gold.

275
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:20,421
When it didn't come, many gave up.

276
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,159
Many more simply perished.

277
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,410
And by 1610, there was only a hundred or so left.

278
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:34,000
James Town was ultimately saved by the efforts and vision of Captain John Smith and the explorer John Rolf.

279
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:42,000
Smith rallied the colonists through the hard times and saw the wisdom in building relationships with the local Senakamokco tribe.

280
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,554
The natives taught the colonists how to farm the land and where to hunt.

281
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:54,388
Smith famously told the settlers that he who does not work shall not eat and convinced the Jamestown people to hang on.

282
00:28:54,388 --> 00:29:01,208
Their fortunes changed in 1610 when John Rolf introduced the tobacco plant from South America.

283
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:11,600
Now Virginia had a crop that would bring in repeat revenue and land started being cleared for tobacco plantations.

284
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:13,403
Cultivation of resources like tobacco was vital since Britain, France

285
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:17,090
and the Dutch operated in a system of mercantalism.

286
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:24,864
Mercantalism held that the world's wealth was finite and a nation only became rich at the expense of others.

287
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:31,840
Therefore, imports needed to be minimized and exports maximized to achieve a positive balance of trade.

288
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:41,120
Colonies allowed the colonized to produce resources without the need to import them from rival powers while selling the rest to boost their exports

289
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,066
creating a positive trade balance.

290
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:55,744
The British and French crowns worked closely with merchants to regulate trade to achieve this goal and generally forbade their colonies from trading with rival mercantilist powers.

291
00:29:55,744 --> 00:30:00,776
English settlement was also taking place further up the east coast.

292
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:08,226
In 1620, Puritans arrived on the Mayflower ship and settled at Plymouth in what would become Massachusetts.

293
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:12,759
The Puritans were like many of the other early European settlers

294
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:19,443
driven to the Americas by religious persecution or being dissatisfied with the religious order back home.

295
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:24,874
Other settlers were displaced farmers, former servants, or retired soldiers.

296
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:31,120
Many were promised their own plots of land after completing an agreed upon contract of labor.

297
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,823
Just as in Virginia, the early Puritans also struggled with famine and the environment

298
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:39,607
but were aided in the early days by native tribes.

299
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:48,559
The relationship soon soured, though, when the local tribes realized the colonists were there to stay and intent on taking their land.

300
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,377
The Europeans had originally planned to work with the natives.

301
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:58,458
Many of the surviving colonists learned to live with the natives

302
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,600
or at least to coexist.

303
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:05,130
Native tribes taught settlers how to farm the land, what crops to grow

304
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,500
and where to hunt.

305
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,577
In turn, the colonists provided plenty of useful and desirable goods.

306
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:17,307
Metal tools, fabrics, weapons, cooking utensils, and mirrors were readily traded

307
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:19,717
as were jewelry and alcohol.

308
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:23,760
Animal skin clothes were replaced by cotton shirts and garments.

309
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:27,591
Metal pots and pans proved to be better than clay utensils.

310
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:32,573
and the European flint and steel made starting fires far easier.

311
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:39,171
Of course, none of this could have taken place without at least some form of basic communication.

312
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:47,482
Natives or settlers who immerse themselves in the other society proved to be highly valuable liaison who could speak several languages.

313
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:56,640
Some natives were captured and forced to become bilingual guides while people from both sides often chose to live in the other cultures society.

314
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:05,072
Relations between the settlers and natives became somewhat easier in some parts with increasing numbers of marriages.

315
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:12,640
These marriages helped develop understanding between vastly different cultures and had the benefit of producing bilingual children.

316
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,876
However, many indigenous people resisted and would have rather died than work or yield to the European invaders.

317
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:26,522
Even some of those who tried to cooperate with the Europeans soon turned against them.

318
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:31,670
For example, the Senakamoko initially accepted trade with the Jamestown settlers

319
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,919
but English ambitions and episodes of violence against native peoples led to open conflict in 1610.

320
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:47,311
Only the marriage of John Rolf with a captured native woman named Pocahontas reconciled the two peoples for a short while.

321
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:51,279
However, after the death of the reigning chief Pohatan in 1618

322
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,830
relations collapsed again.

323
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:02,511
In 1622, the Senakamokco launched a brutal attack on the Virginia colony that killed over 300 settlers.

324
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:12,799
This provoked retaliatory violence from the settlers and another 20 years of violence that resulted in the English seizing vast amounts of land from the outgunned Senakamokco.

325
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,432
Similarly, the Dutch and New Amsterdam suffered a breakdown in relations with native peoples.

326
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:26,110
They had claimed the Dutch introduced the natives to global trade and the Christian faith.

327
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:32,960
Not surprisingly, this meant nothing to the natives, who refused to pay extra payments demanded by the Dutch.

328
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:42,871
Violent battles erupted in 1655, and the Dutch had their African slaves build a protective wall around New Amsterdam in the city's northeast.

329
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:47,978
The street that ran along this wall is now the most famous in New York City

330
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:48,799
Wall Street.

331
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:59,603
Meanwhile, in South America, the 17th century also saw Portugal deciding to spend more money on developing its Brazilian colonies.

332
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:06,640
King John III wanted it to be done properly, so he appointed Tommy Dza as governor general of Brazil.

333
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:14,371
Sa was an experienced administrator who'd served well in Portugal's African and Asian settlements.

334
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:23,012
SOA founded the colonial capital at Salvador in 1549, divided Brazil up into captaincies or land aotment regions

335
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:28,196
and set up municipal organizations modeled on those back in Portugal.

336
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:35,520
By 1600, Bajia and Perumboku each had around 2,000 citizens and more than double that in slaves.

337
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,483
It wasn't all smooth sailing, though, for Portugal.

338
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:44,930
France and the Dutch had ventured into Brazil and liked what they saw.

339
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:52,159
This meant from the mid6th to 17th centuries, Portugal was constantly fighting off French and Dutch invaders.

340
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,735
In 1624, the Dutch briefly took over the capital of Salvador

341
00:34:57,735 --> 00:35:02,240
but Lisbon sent a large battalion into the city to wrangle back control.

342
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,448
While Portugal had started to ramp up settlements in Brazil

343
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:11,118
Spain was making a fortune from its gold and silver mines.

344
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:14,655
This was all overseen by the vice royalty of Peru

345
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:19,557
which was a district set up in the 16th century with its headquarters in Lima.

346
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:30,097
The district controlled a massive chunk of South America, and the vast supplies of silver made Lima Spain's second most important city after Mexico City.

347
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:38,854
People back in Europe started to take keen interest in these new opportunities and settlers began arriving steadily.

348
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:45,141
With so much valuable cargo traveling the sea, European powers funded privateeers

349
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:50,568
a kind of government-backed pirate, to harass and capture the ships of rival nations.

350
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:59,552
No ships were safe traveling across the Atlantic and Spain resorted to forming convoys with heavily armed bodyguard type ships.

351
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:04,725
Extracting the wealth from these new colonies required vast amounts of labor.

352
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:12,055
Disease and conflict had sharply reduced the native population and there weren't enough settlers to do all the needed work.

353
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:15,024
So the Europeans turned to slaves.

354
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:22,336
For the first half of the 17th century, the Atlantic slave trade was largely run by the Portuguese and Spanish.

355
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:26,551
By far, the greatest number of African slaves were sent to Mexico

356
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:31,599
with others being shipped to Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and to Portuguese Brazil.

357
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:39,311
Portugal had the greatest access to slaves because it controlled areas in West Africa such as Angola

358
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:41,964
Cape Verde, and Guinea Basau.

359
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:49,599
Slaves were bought or simply seized from African tribes and shipped either directly to Brazil or to Spanish Hispanola.

360
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:56,720
Thanks to the Iberian Union, Portugal and Spain were united from 1580 to 1640.

361
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:01,005
The main crop in the early days was sugar.

362
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:07,264
The demand for sugar was on the rise in Europe and would go through the roof in the 18th century.

363
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:09,301
Farming sugar was tough work.

364
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:13,913
It was a backbreaking job carried out in stifling heat.

365
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:17,399
In other words, a job fit for slaves.

366
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:21,128
Some slave ships were attacked by fleets from rival countries.

367
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:27,820
British privateeers often raided Spanish slave ships or even slave colonies in the Caribbean.

368
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:33,579
This is how the British acquired their first slaves to be used in the American colonies.

369
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:39,592
In 1619, British privateeers attacked a Spanish slave ship, stole the slaves

370
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:44,031
and then sent them to Virginia to work on the tobacco plantations.

371
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:51,048
As their colonies developed, the English, French, and Dutch became heavily invested in slavery.

372
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:56,992
By 1625, more than 320,000 slaves had been shipped over from Africa.

373
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:02,595
This number would ultimately rise to over 12 million by the 19th century.

374
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:11,138
By the mid7th century, competition between European powers for land and resources in the new world was fierce.

375
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:17,803
Seeking access to Caribbean sugar in 1627, the English settled in Barbados

376
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:24,189
followed by NeAs in 1628 and then Monserat and Antigua in 1632.

377
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:37,839
In 1638, another European power decided to get in on the act when the colony of New Sweden was founded by the Swedish South Company.

378
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:43,298
This was a joint venture of Swedish, Dutch, and German business interests who were keen to set up trade links on the east coast.

379
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:48,744
New Sweden was based along the Delaware River with settlements in today's Delaware

380
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,013
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

381
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:56,053
Conflicts between these European powers regularly played out in the colonies.

382
00:38:56,053 --> 00:39:00,160
For example, Britain invaded French Canada during the 30 Years War

383
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:10,400
besieging and capturing Quebec, although they handed it back to the French in 1632.

384
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,213
This was to be a familiar pattern over the next 100 or so years.

385
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:17,594
Conflicts in Europe having a huge influence on the balance of power in America.

386
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:23,717
Of course, this European expansion came at the expense of indigenous peoples.

387
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:28,800
The Europeans came from cultures that lived with domesticated animals such as cows

388
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,032
pigs, sheep, and chickens.

389
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:35,920
This brought new strains of disease that were completely foreign to these people.

390
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:45,929
Smallox, influenza, typhus, yellow fever, and measles were all new to the Americas and were soon spread throughout the native populations.

391
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:51,119
Weapons were readily traded with the settlers with firearms being the most sought after.

392
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:58,079
This increased the level of violence between tribes as natives began using the more advanced weapons on each other.

393
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:05,829
War was now more lethal as the natives became quickly proficient in the use of musketss and pistols.

394
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:11,920
This easy access to deadlier weapons had another telling effect on the native population decline.

395
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,019
It also took a serious toll on the environment.

396
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:22,856
Because many natives wanted more guns, they began hunting more animals for their furs and clearing more land.

397
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:24,800
Soil erosion became a problem.

398
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,440
While wildlife habitats and species became threatened in New England

399
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,196
beavers were virtually extinct by the 18th century.

400
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,594
Such was the demand for their fur.

401
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:43,712
No more beavers meant no more ponds, which reduced fish numbers and watering holes for other animals such as deer and moose.

402
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:48,594
Europeans introduced farm animals such as pigs, goats, and cows

403
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:54,704
which were allowed to wander around grazing freely on much of the food traditionally eaten by deer

404
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:56,880
which further reduced the hunting options.

405
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,000
Alcohol was a real scourge on the indigenous populations.

406
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,684
Some people quickly became addicted, leading to early deaths, broken homes

407
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:09,408
and the breakdown of tribal structures.

408
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:15,324
Tribal elders naturally voiced their disapproval and did all they could to limit consumption.

409
00:41:15,324 --> 00:41:19,712
But many leaders themselves became addicted, compounding the problem.

410
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:25,012
It's estimated that in the 150 years that followed Columbus's arrival

411
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:29,230
the American natives lost roughly 80% of their population.

412
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:36,480
Between 1492 and 1650, the numbers had plummeted from 50 million to just 8 million.

413
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:46,547
As the 17th century neared its halfway point, there had already been huge changes since Columbus first landed in the Americas.

414
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:52,640
Native populations had been decimated and slavery was about to become a booming industry.

415
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,960
Spain was still very much the dominant power, but the seemingly endless supplies of silver and gold were beginning to trickle out.

416
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,035
Brazil was slowly building into a formidable South American country

417
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:10,512
and the Portuguese and Spanish were bonded via the Iberian Union.

418
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:17,645
Meanwhile, the other two European superpowers, Britain and France, had made their intentions clear.

419
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:21,434
They'd both had a taste of what North America had to offer

420
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:26,203
and they liked it a lot, and were in it for the long haul.

421
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:34,960
The next 100 or so years were about to bring further changes that would completely transform the world as everyone knew it.

422
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:44,313
150 years after Columbus's arrival, European colonization of the Americas had seen great success

423
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:51,642
the five major European colonial powers had all carved out significant chunks of the new world for themselves

424
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:58,079
forcing those already there to adapt, accept, or resist if they hadn't already died from disease.

425
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:09,040
The second half of the 17th century would only prove that the Europeans were there to stay as the new world became the arena for imported European wars

426
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:17,451
radical political and religious experiments, and lucrative industries built off the backs of servants and slaves.

427
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:23,040
The story of European colonization was only getting faster and more intense.

428
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:34,935
We'll start with England, or rather New England, which by 1650 boasted 40 towns and 23,000 colonists.

429
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:46,306
Conscious of their rising prosperity and shared cultures, the New England Confederation was formed in 1643 to unify the colonies of Massachusetts Bay

430
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:53,656
Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven in what proved to be foreshadowing for future colonial cooperation.

431
00:43:53,656 --> 00:44:02,400
The small outcast colony of Rhode Island was omitted from the Confederation and New Haven was annexed entirely by Connecticut in 1664.

432
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,200
But already New England was taking a recognizable shape.

433
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:19,842
Religious disscent, a frontier mentality with deep connections to the Native Americans and a proud culture of independence from the crown defined New England against the old.

434
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:24,892
Economically, New England was never the most lucrative of England's colonies.

435
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:32,284
The West Indies far outclassed it in wealth generated, but the quality of life New Englanders could enjoy was high.

436
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:36,629
The average family could expect to own lands to farm what they needed

437
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:45,088
and propertied men could expect a role in influencing politics that was more direct than what a typical Englishman across the Atlantic would expect.

438
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:50,574
While the sugar fortunes of the Caribbean eclipsed New England's humble economy

439
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:57,440
it benefited from good agricultural land, vast fishing stocks, and huge forests for lumber.

440
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,043
By 1700, New England's fishing and ship building industries was among the best in the world

441
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:07,520
and England itself was buying some of its vessels from them.

442
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:15,119
Most importantly for most New Englanders, colonial life offered them the freedom to worship as they pleased.

443
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:22,160
Puritanism's dominance in New England was already fading as an even wider tapestry of religious denominations

444
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:29,010
including Baptists, congressionalists, and Quakers, flocked to the freedom of the new world.

445
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,861
Not all was as it seemed, though.

446
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:36,560
Religious toleration was defined in strict Protestant dissenter limits.

447
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,812
Anglicans were not welcome, nor Catholics.

448
00:45:39,812 --> 00:45:43,073
And even the Quakers faced significant discrimination.

449
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:49,760
They were banished from Massachusetts in the 1650s, and at least four Quakers were hanged for preaching their faith.

450
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:58,699
Religious feeling was high in New England, and nothing showed the risks of that like the Salem witch trials of 1691 and 1692

451
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:10,720
where intense paranoia led to hundreds being accused and 19 people executed for the imagined crime of witchcraft.

452
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,845
Relations with the indigenous people were also difficult.

453
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:18,467
In 1675, New England experienced a wave of conflicts with the Algangquin natives

454
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:24,000
led by a warrior named Metacomt, but who was known to the English as King Phillip.

455
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:30,039
The New Englanders had demanded Metacomt's people surrender weapons and land to them

456
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,985
and Metacomt agreed at first, but as their demands grew

457
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:38,004
he knew they could either fight or lose everything.

458
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:52,480
King Philip's war led to more than half of New England's towns being attacked and a dozen being burned to the ground and harsh reprisals against the Algangquins led to the destruction of many settlements and food stores belonging to Metaccomat's men.

459
00:46:53,510 --> 00:47:03,719
The war lasted until August 1676 when Metac was shot by an Indian Christian convert and the Native Alliance collapsed without his leadership.

460
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:07,543
Anger at Native Americans was intense in the wake of the war

461
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:13,163
and some Virginiaians called for the total expulsion of Native Americans from the territory.

462
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:19,680
Governor William Berkeley refused, but quickly found himself with a rebellion on his hands by discontented Virginiaians.

463
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:26,293
Bacon's rebellion in 1676, named for its leader, Nathaniel Bacon

464
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:32,060
called for Berkeley's dismissal and a total expulsion of Native Americans from Virginia.

465
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:41,333
The rebellion was swiftly put down by government loyalists, but not before several loyalist settlements were attacked and over 100 Native Americans were killed.

466
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:47,257
Although it lasted only a few months, Bacon's rebellion was remarkable for two key reasons.

467
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:53,106
First, it involved both white settlers and Africans, slave and non-slave

468
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:55,191
against the Native Americans.

469
00:47:55,191 --> 00:48:05,680
The realization that the two groups might unify caused the colonial government to draw stricter legal separation between black and white to ensure they wouldn't rise up again

470
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,623
which encouraged racial division and hostility in the long term.

471
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:15,973
It was also the first significant rebellion by colonists against colonial rule.

472
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:26,780
It would not be the last and future historians have seen in Bacon's Rebellion the first seeds that would sprout into the American Revolution a century later.

473
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:42,069
The remaining Indians in New England scattered or were enslaved or were forced into secondass citizen status in so-called praying towns which were supposed to be the centers of Christian conversion but mostly functioned as reservations.

474
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,791
The hostility between New Englanders and natives remained.

475
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:57,895
And this attitude is best seen in the words of Massachusetts Minister Solomon Stoddard writing to the governor in 1682 who suggested dogs be trained to hunt Indians.

476
00:48:57,895 --> 00:49:02,613
Quote, "They act like wolves and are to be dealt with as wolves.

477
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:11,444
" Moving north from New England, the Dutch in New Netherland were also eager to assert their place.

478
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:16,454
The Dutch had been a competitive player in American colonization.

479
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:20,718
With New Netherlands in the north, multiple islands in the Caribbean

480
00:49:20,718 --> 00:49:26,640
and a valuable presence in Brazil, the Dutch had carved out a decent chunk of the colonial pie.

481
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,273
However, the mid-7th century proved that the Dutch were overstretched.

482
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:36,955
Their wide presence encroached on the interests of multiple rival powers

483
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:42,777
especially the British and the Portuguese, that provoked conflict with each.

484
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:47,680
Since 1630, the Dutch had claimed a portion of northern Brazil from the Portuguese

485
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,410
which they had dubbed New Holland.

486
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,516
The colony was their way to break into the sugar trade.

487
00:49:53,516 --> 00:50:02,984
But the relatively low number of Dutch settlers were forever outnumbered by Brazilian natives and Portuguese settlers who never accepted Dutch rule.

488
00:50:02,984 --> 00:50:08,612
In 1645, the Portuguese and New Holland rebelled, defeated the Dutch forces

489
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:12,035
and invited the Portuguese Empire to claim the territory.

490
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:15,934
The Dutch scrambled an expeditionary force to reclaim the colony

491
00:50:15,934 --> 00:50:22,025
but they were decisively defeated at the two battles of Guadapes in 1648 and 1649.

492
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:31,581
The last Dutch colonists in Brazil held out in the city of Hifa until 1654 when Portugal finally kicked them out of South America.

493
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:34,469
The Dutch saw similar disaster up north.

494
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:46,226
The British recognized that New Netherland would be a perfect entry point to deal with the French upriver in Canada and would allow them to control the unbroken span of the eastern seabboard.

495
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:52,984
England realized that the Dutch had overexerted themselves and were weak in the wake of their defeats in Brazil.

496
00:50:52,984 --> 00:51:02,348
So on August 27th, 1664, British ships sailed into the harbor of New Amsterdam and demanded the surrender of the entire colony.

497
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:07,126
With no forces to resist, the Dutch colonial administrators surrendered.

498
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:11,529
A few months later, the Second Anglo Dutch War erupted in Europe.

499
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:15,885
As well as preventing any Dutch attempts to reclaim the colonies

500
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:20,994
the war gave Britain the chance to seize some of its possessions in the Caribbean too

501
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,007
like Tobago.

502
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:25,576
The Dutch did manage to acquire Surinam from the British

503
00:51:25,576 --> 00:51:33,359
but with the end of the war in 1667, the Dutch had clearly lost their place as one of the major colonial powers in the Americas.

504
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:38,828
With the Dutch out of the way in North America

505
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:42,559
the English were free to expand their control of the eastern seabboard.

506
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:51,260
Aside from New England, Canada, and the Carolas, the British now had to concern themselves with the middle colonies of New York

507
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,261
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.

508
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:58,981
When taken from the Dutch, New Netherland was under the control of James

509
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:02,320
Duke of York, the younger brother of King Charles II

510
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,839
and soon to be king himself.

511
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:10,318
New Amsterdam was renamed New York, but its Dutch inhabitants were mostly left alone.

512
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,400
James instructed his appointed governors to rule with a gentle hand

513
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,280
but power remained firmly in his grasp.

514
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:24,349
New York was given no elected assembly, and the proprietor could wield power as he pleased.

515
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:30,309
James could never hope to actively govern such a large area from so far away.

516
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:38,615
So in 1664 he cut off a chunk of New Netherlands to grant to his allies Lords John Berkeley and Sir John Carteret.

517
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:44,065
Rather than develop this new area of New Jersey, they sold their shares to another group

518
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:44,640
the Quakers.

519
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:48,926
The Quakers were heavily persecuted back in England.

520
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:52,112
So the colonies offered a perfect chance to start a new.

521
00:52:52,112 --> 00:52:58,080
Jersey received a steady stream of new Quaker settlers to add to the existing Dutch population.

522
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,359
But the true success of Quaker colonization was Pennsylvania.

523
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:11,693
Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II grant his proprietary rights to the Quaker financier William Penn.

524
00:53:11,693 --> 00:53:20,934
Penn envisioned a new society across the Atlantic where Quakers and other religious minorities could live peacefully and without persecution.

525
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:28,516
In 1682, some 2,000 settlers made the trip to Pennsylvania where they founded its capital at Philadelphia

526
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:31,359
and about 6,000 more followed by 1685.

527
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,568
Penn was happy to grant generous parcels of lands to small holders

528
00:53:37,568 --> 00:53:40,640
Quaker and non-Quaker alike, to build his society.

529
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:45,440
With an elected assembly and significant local and individual freedom

530
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:51,662
Pennsylvania was a thriving model for new world colonization, but not a perfect one.

531
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:56,997
More staunch Quakers wanted Penn to prioritize building a religious society

532
00:53:56,997 --> 00:54:02,760
while Penn was still a proprietor who was always careful to ensure profits kept climbing.

533
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,240
This left some Quakers to leave Pennsylvania in favor of Quaker controlled New Jersey.

534
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,663
But Penn's work seemed to pay off anyway.

535
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:19,359
By 1700, Pennsylvania was home to 18,000 colonists, and Philadelphia was rapidly becoming one of the largest

536
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,747
wealthiest, and best educated cities in America.

537
00:54:23,747 --> 00:54:36,880
Disruption came in 1685 when the newly crowned James II ordered the unification of New England with New York and New Jersey to create the crown controlled Dominion of New England.

538
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:44,421
Local authority was severely limited and Anglican and even Catholic worship was to be tolerated.

539
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:55,040
Alas, James proved to be an unpopular monarch and was peacefully deposed in favor of the Dutch Prince William and his wife Mary during the glorious rebellion of 1688.

540
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:01,020
It took until the next few years for news to reach the colonies.

541
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,200
The Dominion government, loyal to James II, was reluctant to give up power

542
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,480
but rebellions in New York and Massachusetts forced the Dominion to collapse.

543
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:16,452
However, King William III was not so eager to let royal control slip.

544
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:32,559
The dominion was dissolved back into separate colonies, but he imposed royal governors upon Massachusetts and New Hampshire to tighten English control and maintained a more tolerant religious policy that spells the end of Puritan dominance in New England.

545
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:40,664
Beyond that, there are two other areas of English colonization worthy of attention.

546
00:55:40,664 --> 00:55:47,945
In 1649, King Charles I lost his head and England passed to the control of Oliver Cromwell.

547
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:52,027
A staunch Puritan with an insatiable hatred of Catholics.

548
00:55:52,027 --> 00:55:56,816
Britain spent most of Cromwell's reign locked in war with Catholic Spain.

549
00:55:56,816 --> 00:56:01,230
The main result of this being the British capture of Jamaica in 1655

550
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:07,680
giving Britain control of one of the largest and most lucrative sugar producing islands in the Caribbean.

551
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:13,440
Combined with Barbados and the leeward isles like Antigua, Monserat and St.

552
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:20,134
Nevice, Britain was well positioned to turn the Caribbean into a sugar producing powerhouse.

553
00:56:20,134 --> 00:56:28,720
While the North American colonies are better known, the 17th and early 18th century was really the age of Britain's Caribbean Empire.

554
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:37,502
Hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar sailed back across the Atlantic from Britain's Caribbean colonies over the following decades.

555
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:41,018
At first, indentured whites were the main labor force.

556
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:45,661
Again, Cromwell being in power at the start had special relevance.

557
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:50,218
He needed a place to put all those pesky Irish and Scots he captured

558
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:54,596
and forcing them across the Atlantic to grow sugar for him was as good a plan as any.

559
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:58,203
But English and Welsh indentures were sent as well.

560
00:56:58,203 --> 00:57:05,318
Of the 223,000 white colonists who came to the Caribbean between 1630 and 1700

561
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,599
around half of them were indentured servants.

562
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:11,273
Almost all of them bound for sugar production.

563
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:18,423
Soon enough though, demand for labor outstripped the indentured supply and slavery came to dominate.

564
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:24,266
The Caribbean was the primary destination for slaves in Britain's transatlantic slave trading

565
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:28,850
and the numbers grew sharply between 1642 and 1700.

566
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:36,559
The founding of the Royal Africa Company in 1672 ensured the smooth transportation of slaves to the Caribbean colonies.

567
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:45,343
Barbados had around 5,700 African slaves in 1645, swelling to 42,000 by 1698

568
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:54,078
while Jamaica's 1,410 slaves in 1656 had become over 41,000 in 1698.

569
00:57:54,078 --> 00:58:08,000
The slave population significantly outnumbered the white population who kept control with violence and aggressive legal codes that restricted slaves and defined their status as innate and inherent to their skin color.

570
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:14,416
In contrast to New England with its many independent landowning families and pleasant towns

571
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:23,606
the Caribbean colonies were a place where most people lived in servitude to a narrow plantation elite who'd grown rich from the enslavement of others.

572
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:37,760
By 1700, Caribbean sugar was producing some 3 million pounds of value per year at the cost of about 200,000 African slaves brought into the British Caribbean or North American ports.

573
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:44,319
Plantation wealth was also key to the other great arena of British colonial efforts

574
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,386
Carolina.

575
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:52,987
In 1663, Charles II granted land rights to eight powerful proprietors in the territory of Carolina.

576
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:57,639
The first permanent settlement was laid down at Charleston in 1670.

577
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:08,346
And Carolina quickly grew to be a valuable colony with a thriving slave plantation economy in the south with more independent family farming based communities in the north.

578
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:15,040
The proprietors were mostly hands-off, taking little interest in the colony from their comfy homes back in England.

579
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,724
The one exception was the Earl of Shsbury, who along with the philosopher John Lockach

580
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,640
attempted to craft Carolina into a perfect society.

581
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:36,001
The fundamental constitutions of Carolina attempted to outline a society that blended liberal ideas of freedom and democracy with slavery and hereditary nobility.

582
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:40,646
The bizarre experiment was a failure from start to finish.

583
00:59:40,646 --> 00:59:53,105
Carolans resented the proprietor's outofouch attempts to remake society which they answered with resistance or just by ignoring them entirely to focus on their farms and plantations.

584
00:59:53,105 --> 01:00:01,044
Still, by 1700, royal power was probably the strongest it had been in the British colonies since settlement began.

585
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:05,546
But this fact did not sit comfortably among the American colonists.

586
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:10,657
After generations, most of them had little loyalty to the mother country.

587
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:14,884
And with the soaring prosperity and stability of colonial life

588
01:00:14,884 --> 01:00:19,187
many began to feel that the colonies had surpassed England.

589
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:24,480
Did a distant country few of them had ever visited really deserve to rule them?

590
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,440
That question would only grow louder as the 18th century dawned.

591
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,044
There's no talking about the British without addressing the French

592
01:00:35,044 --> 01:00:40,993
who took the lead in colonizing Canada and the inland areas of North America.

593
01:00:40,993 --> 01:00:44,947
1642 saw the French settle another new colony in Montreal

594
01:00:44,947 --> 01:00:47,446
deepening their foothold in the north.

595
01:00:47,446 --> 01:00:53,920
France's main concern was to establish its influence over and security in the Great Lakes region.

596
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,424
But doing this required engaging with the great power that was already there

597
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:00,305
the Irakcoy Confederacy.

598
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:04,920
The Irakcoy Confederacy was an alliance of five nations.

599
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,863
The Kyuga, the Mohawk, the Onida, the Onundaga, and the Senica

600
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:16,799
who had joined together under the great law of peace to end fighting in the region centuries before the Europeans arrived.

601
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:23,471
Naturally, the Irakcoy were wary about the newcomers, and like many Native American groups

602
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:28,482
they navigated the arrival of the Europeans with an eye to their own interests.

603
01:01:28,482 --> 01:01:32,597
With the French posing a bigger threat to their ancestral territory

604
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:39,956
the Urkquoy took advantage of France's rivalry with England and the Netherlands to trade with Dutch and English merchants for weapons

605
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:44,172
which they could then use to resist French encroachment on their land.

606
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:48,170
The Beaver Wars raged for most of the 17th century.

607
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:54,498
As French settlers encroached on their territory, the Irakcoy resisted with violent force.

608
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:59,119
In turn, they launched attacks on French settlements, traders, and explorers.

609
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,474
Other indigenous groups like the Huron took a different approach

610
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:05,847
seeking alliances with the French.

611
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:11,742
The Huron and several other indigenous groups, many with long-standing rivalries with the Irakquoy

612
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:13,639
took up arms against them.

613
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:17,322
The resulting Beaver Wars were as much, if not more so

614
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:24,699
a conflict between differently aligned native peoples as it was a war between the French and the native peoples.

615
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:31,040
As in every corner of the Americas, there was no single unified response to European settlement

616
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:38,270
and different groups fought, traded, ignored, integrated, and cooperated as they saw fit.

617
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:41,567
Fighting rose and fell over the century.

618
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:49,920
An extended period of peace between the French and Irakcoy began from 1666 as the latter turned their attention to other native groups.

619
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,163
But war resumed in the 1680s.

620
01:02:53,163 --> 01:02:57,901
The nine years war between Britain and France, which began in 1688

621
01:02:57,901 --> 01:03:05,966
spilled over into the Americas as King Williams war with the Irakquoy allied with the British and the Huron with the French

622
01:03:05,966 --> 01:03:11,604
triggering a renewed wave of conflict that only ended with peace in 1697.

623
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:18,160
By that point, the Urkoy controlled much of the New England frontier and the Ohio River Valley.

624
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:24,127
Beyond Canada, France's primary interest lay in the Mississippi River Basin.

625
01:03:24,127 --> 01:03:28,013
They explored the basin from the 1670s and in 1682

626
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:34,799
Renee Robert Cavalier De Lasal declared the entire river system to be the French possession of Louisiana.

627
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:41,513
Louisiana was divided into upper and lower regions separated at the Arkansas River.

628
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:47,280
Upper Louisiana was formed from the upper Mississippi Valley, which included today's states of Illinois

629
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:53,042
Missouri, and Indiana, while everything to the south was lower Louisiana.

630
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:57,786
French settlers from Canada moved into the area in the late 17th century.

631
01:03:57,786 --> 01:04:06,854
Attracted by the vast fertile farming land, the upper Louisiana region also had an abundance of animals that could be hunted for furs or food.

632
01:04:06,854 --> 01:04:11,255
Early settlement in lower Louisiana was hard and unsuccessful.

633
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:15,760
The first permanent French colony was actually in modern Texas at Fort St.

634
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,628
Louis.

635
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:24,196
Founded in 1685, it lasted just 3 years before indigenous locals conquered it and slaughtered the population.

636
01:04:24,196 --> 01:04:29,259
Small villages and forts were planted across the Louisiana territory with more success

637
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:37,200
but large-scale colonization would have to wait until the 18th century.

638
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:39,566
While the French weren't having the best time of it in the second half of the 17th century

639
01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:42,880
they could at least say they were doing better than the Spanish.

640
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:48,634
Spain's experiences in the New World were downstream of their troubles in the old.

641
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:53,129
The second half of the 17th century was one of difficulty for the Spanish crown

642
01:04:53,129 --> 01:04:56,772
which sapped attention and resources from the Americas.

643
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:09,104
The rising power of France, especially during the long reign of Louis I 14th and the breakdown of the Iberian Union between Spain and Portugal left the Spanish crown weak and exhausted.

644
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:14,956
Their French, Dutch, Portuguese, and English rivals were keen to capitalize on that

645
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:17,520
such as England seizing Jamaica in 1655.

646
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:22,280
Spain had plenty of trouble from the Americas, too.

647
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:31,684
Massive native depopulation had severely limited the labor supply and Spain was unable to muscle its way into the Atlantic slave trade.

648
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:40,043
Spanish colonies struggled to find the labor needed to produce sugar or mine the gold and silver which had made the empire so wealthy.

649
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:44,796
The slaves they did buy were mostly bought through their imperial rivals.

650
01:05:44,796 --> 01:05:50,000
Meanwhile, the native populations who remained became increasingly resistant to Spanish rule.

651
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:56,960
In Peru, the native Inca launched dozens of small-scale rebellions against exploitative Spanish practices

652
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,111
including forced labor for the state and price gouging by Spanish officials

653
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,814
who forced them to buy tools and supplies from overpriced Spanish sources

654
01:06:06,814 --> 01:06:10,743
then sell their produce to the Spanish at a discounted price

655
01:06:10,743 --> 01:06:13,857
which the Spanish then sold on for a profit.

656
01:06:13,857 --> 01:06:17,114
Specific areas brought their own problems, too.

657
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:30,769
Spanish settlements in Florida slowed to a trickle as a lack of exploitable resources or exploitable native labor caused interest in the region to wne with the British and French expanding even further southward.

658
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:38,559
Florida became more of a buffer for the more valuable Caribbean and Central American colonies than it was a valuable holding itself.

659
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:43,903
Not that Florida protected Spanish ships in the Caribbean from their real scourge

660
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:44,448
pirates.

661
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:55,807
The second half of the 17th century was the golden age of piracy with European ships constantly harassed by independent pirates or privateeers backed by their rivals.

662
01:06:55,807 --> 01:07:00,631
The English proved especially bothersome with privateeers based out of Charles Town

663
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:02,400
modern-day Nassau in the Bahamas.

664
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:08,237
A Spanish fleet successfully raided the town and burned it to the ground in 1684.

665
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:11,454
But the pirate menace was far from solved.

666
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:15,453
With Inca rebels in the south, pirates in the Caribbean

667
01:07:15,453 --> 01:07:24,589
and rival Europeans everywhere, it is probably no surprise that Spain faced resistance in its North American territory of New Mexico

668
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:24,958
too.

669
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,945
The Pueblo people of New Mexico had long suffered under Spanish rule.

670
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:36,235
And in 1680, they launched a fullscale rebellion named for its warrior leader.

671
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:43,536
Poe's rebellion led to the expulsion of Spanish settlers from New Mexico and the killing of several hundred of them.

672
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:48,714
It was one of the most successful examples of indigenous resistance in the Americas

673
01:07:48,714 --> 01:07:51,286
but that success was short-lived.

674
01:07:51,286 --> 01:07:56,971
Poppe died in 1688 and without his leadership, the will for independence faded.

675
01:07:56,971 --> 01:08:05,772
When the Spanish returned in 1692, they were able to peacefully convince the majority of the Pueblo people to accept Spanish rule again.

676
01:08:05,772 --> 01:08:16,256
However, the Spanish no longer subjected the Pueblo to forced labor on the exploitative Encoma system and rolled back missionary work in their communities

677
01:08:16,256 --> 01:08:23,520
allowing the Pueblins to retain more of their independence and culture than most Native American groups did under colonial rule.

678
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:31,159
That leaves us with Portugal, who experienced more stable dominance in South America.

679
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:37,338
The expulsion of the Dutch in 1654 assured Portuguese control of Brazil

680
01:08:37,338 --> 01:08:45,238
and the 1668 treaty of Lisbon further secured their sphere of influence by ending hostilities with Spain.

681
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:56,792
As a result, Portugal was free to expand and refine its colonial control and turn Brazil into the global powerhouse of sugar production and a slave exploitation.

682
01:08:56,792 --> 01:09:12,400
Portugal tightened up colonial administration with an overseas council to manage colonial affairs and the expansion of the use of colonial administrators and local elites known as the Sanhores deeno to manage local affairs.

683
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,264
As in the Caribbean, slavery was the engine that powered Brazil.

684
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:21,861
By 1700, half a million African slaves had been shipped there

685
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:25,866
and more were born into servitude from those imported slaves.

686
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:30,947
The life expectancy of a fresh slave brought into Brazil was a few years at most

687
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:35,318
and most of those born there did not live to see 25.

688
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:42,952
But unlike elsewhere, the Portuguese state was more permissive towards intermarriage and relations between white colonists

689
01:09:42,952 --> 01:09:48,735
indigenous people, and Africans, which was already giving rise to a mysticio population.

690
01:09:48,735 --> 01:09:54,732
Race relations in Brazil would forever be different to those in other European colonies.

691
01:09:54,732 --> 01:10:05,440
As a result, while Brazil's sugar trade grew steadily, the rapid expansion of Caribbean sugar after the 1650s ate away at Portugal's dominance of the trade.

692
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:11,749
Nevertheless, sugar and slavery continued and inevitably slaves resisted.

693
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,760
As early as6003, escaped slaves had been gathering at Palmarees.

694
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:21,440
But after the Dutch expulsion in 1654, the numbers of escaped slaves swelled.

695
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:29,760
By the 1670s, this community of escaped slaves was styling itself as an independent kingdom named Angola Janga.

696
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:38,105
Multiple Portuguese attempts to shut it down failed against the difficult tropical terrain and fierce resistance of the warriors.

697
01:10:38,105 --> 01:10:44,109
Its self-styled King Ganga Zumba commanded soldiers, regulated trade in his territory

698
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:46,373
and even built himself a palace.

699
01:10:46,373 --> 01:10:51,632
In 1678, the Portuguese officially recognized him as a legitimate ruler.

700
01:10:51,632 --> 01:10:57,224
so long as he submitted to Portuguese authority, becoming a sort of client king.

701
01:10:57,224 --> 01:11:02,572
Zumba agreed, but such a capitulation was not welcomed by his rivals.

702
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:05,512
His nephew Zumbi launched a revolt.

703
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:08,906
Gangazumba was killed and Zumbi took his place.

704
01:11:08,906 --> 01:11:14,441
For the next 15 years, Zumbi doggedly defended Palaris's independence.

705
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:30,148
Eventually though in January 1694 another Portuguese expedition under Domingos Gorge Vervo assaulted Zumbi's seat of power had circa de Macakaco conquering it and capturing Zumbbe who was eventually beheaded.

706
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:40,080
The suppression of Palarez was a welcome development for the Portuguese but it was a reminder of the risks of the sugar trade and its dependence on slaves.

707
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:53,019
So the discovery of gold in the Miner region of Brazil by Portuguese explorers in the 1690s offered a welcome new source of wealth as Portugal entered the new century.

708
01:11:53,019 --> 01:12:02,904
The 18th century got off to an auspicious start when every major European nation fell into a bloody conflict over the Spanish throne.

709
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:08,960
The death of Charles II of Spain in November 1700 left a secession crisis for Spain.

710
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:14,955
Charles and France backs the inheritance of 17-year-old Philip of Anju

711
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,173
a grandson of Louis I 14th.

712
01:12:17,173 --> 01:12:22,827
Such a close union between France and Spain was unacceptable to the other European powers

713
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:29,520
especially Britain, the Dutch, and the Holy Roman Empire, triggering the war of Spanish secession.

714
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,728
Most of the fighting played out in Europe.

715
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:42,784
But by now any European war was also a colonial war and the American theater of conflict became known as Queen Anne's war.

716
01:12:42,784 --> 01:12:50,157
The British with their native allies fought fiercely against the French and Spanish with their native allies.

717
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:58,402
The most significant developments of the war saw the British capture the French province of Aadia comprising modern-day Nova Scotia

718
01:12:58,402 --> 01:13:01,871
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island in 1710.

719
01:13:01,871 --> 01:13:05,360
Fighting ended with the peace of Utre in 1713.

720
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:11,683
Phipe kept his Spanish throne, but lost a lot of his European territory.

721
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:15,792
In the Americas, the war had two major consequences.

722
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:21,705
First, the permanent French laws of Aadia, Newfoundland, and Hudson Bay to the British.

723
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:27,625
And second, the granting of the Asiento denigrat to Britain by Spain.

724
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:35,040
The Asiento granted Britain the exclusive right to sell African slaves to the Spanish Empire.

725
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:45,199
Spain kept its American empire intact, but the concession reduced Spain to humiliating dependence upon Britain for a key piece of its economy.

726
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:51,440
Emerging from the war of Spanish secession, Spain had taken a beating

727
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:54,320
but Philipe V was secure on his throne.

728
01:13:55,030 --> 01:14:00,848
The war had demonstrated that Spain's economy and navy had fallen far behind its rivals.

729
01:14:00,848 --> 01:14:06,757
Philip's long reign was one of internal reforms to modernize and improve Spain's government

730
01:14:06,757 --> 01:14:11,414
military, and economy, which he did with mixed success.

731
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:16,806
He also pushed to expand Spain's American Empire, especially into Texas

732
01:14:16,806 --> 01:14:19,672
where San Antonio was founded in 1718.

733
01:14:19,672 --> 01:14:25,284
Key to Spanish imperialism across the New World, were the Jesuits.

734
01:14:25,284 --> 01:14:31,897
This Catholic order took the lead in missionary work and education on Spain's imperial frontier.

735
01:14:31,897 --> 01:14:42,652
Many of the frontier settlements and native outreach communities were run by Jesuits and they were often the main link between native subjects and colonial powers.

736
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:49,440
However, due to changing attitudes in Catholicism and controversies about Jesuit power

737
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,400
the Jesuits fell out of favor with Catholic Europe by the mid 18th century.

738
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:06,264
In 1750, as part of the Treaty of Madrid, Spain tried to exchange several Jesuit mission communities in Paraguay with Portugal for more valuable territory.

739
01:15:06,264 --> 01:15:12,289
The Jesuits, angry at being abandoned and with strong influence over the native Guini

740
01:15:12,289 --> 01:15:14,574
incited the Guini to rebel.

741
01:15:14,574 --> 01:15:21,350
The Guini wars saw Portugal and Spain team up for several years to suppress the local revolt.

742
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:27,107
And when all was said and done, they laid the blame firmly on the Jesuits.

743
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:34,267
In 1767, they were expelled from all parts of the empire and their property seized by the crown.

744
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:44,080
In the long run, this would be disastrous for Spanish native relations and would contribute to the weakening of Spanish imperial authority that would eventually allow for independence.

745
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,840
There were other signs of weakness, too.

746
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:54,929
The gold and silver mines of Peru, which had made Spanish colonization so profitable at first

747
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:57,490
were drying up by the mid 18th century.

748
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:06,599
The native Inca were also restless with dozens of localized rebellions against Spanish rule that caused much anxiety and disruption.

749
01:16:06,599 --> 01:16:13,794
Peru's wealth and importance declined in turn and focus shifted to other areas of colonization.

750
01:16:13,794 --> 01:16:18,642
As if to prove this, in 1776 the territory of Argentina

751
01:16:18,642 --> 01:16:29,791
Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and most of Chile was split off from the declining vice royalty of Peru and reorganized into the vice royalty of Rio de la Plata.

752
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:38,808
Spain also tried to compensate for its imperial decline with California which saw its first major settlements at San Diego in 1769

753
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:46,880
Los Angeles in 1771, and San Francisco in 1776.

754
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:52,480
But Spanish settlement there was always an afterthought, and they never did discover the goals that would one day make the region so prosperous.

755
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:01,356
Things were a bit more stable for Portugal, who avoided getting embroiled in most of the colonial wars in the Americas.

756
01:17:01,356 --> 01:17:07,840
Its secure position down in Brazil and lack of ambition elsewhere minimized conflicts with Britain

757
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,616
France, and Spain.

758
01:17:09,616 --> 01:17:16,400
The Treaty of Madrid in 1750 firmly recognized Portuguese and Spanish interests in South America

759
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,199
reducing the risk of conflict even more.

760
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:28,529
As a result, Portuguese colonial affairs were relatively low-key compared to the history shaping events going on elsewhere.

761
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:35,587
The discovery of gold had triggered a gold rush in the early 18th century that dominated affairs in Brazil.

762
01:17:35,587 --> 01:17:41,232
The discovery of diamonds in 1729 only reinforced the pivot away from sugar

763
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:45,810
the center of which had now shifted to the Caribbean in favor of mining.

764
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:55,805
Reflecting this shift, the colonial capital moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro in 1763 to be closer to the mining areas.

765
01:17:55,805 --> 01:18:00,355
These mines had no less need for slaves than the plantations did.

766
01:18:00,355 --> 01:18:11,417
Brazil continued to be the primary destination for African slaves heading to the new world with almost 2 million of them imported to Brazil over the 18th century.

767
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:19,199
This continued expansion of the African population prompted harsher racial laws to rigidly define racial hierarchy.

768
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:26,790
Europeans at the top, mechisos below, Africans below that, and the indigenous peoples last of all.

769
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:40,647
Portuguese attempts to forcibly subjugate this dwindling indigenous population as expressed through the digtorio dos indos laws of 1757 only further destroyed indigenous communities with violence

770
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:43,040
forced resettlement, and legal discrimination.

771
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,759
But the pivotal events of this period would come from the north.

772
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:51,998
So let's pivot back to the British.

773
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:56,742
The early 18th century was the golden age of Britain's American Empire.

774
01:18:56,742 --> 01:19:00,421
But the cracks that would break it were already visible.

775
01:19:00,421 --> 01:19:04,820
Each British colony had different government arrangements.

776
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:11,811
Each colony's assembly and governor, if they had either, could expect different powers and privileges.

777
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:17,661
While Britain tried to assert more centralized control through royal governors

778
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:22,560
realities on the ground prevented the establishment of consistent administrative structure.

779
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:30,603
For example, the crown could disallow most colonial laws, but not those of Connecticut or Rhode Island.

780
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:35,347
Royal governors regularly buted heads with the elected colonial assemblies

781
01:19:35,347 --> 01:19:39,294
who each saw their legitimacy drawn from different sources.

782
01:19:39,294 --> 01:19:42,597
The former from the crown, the latter from the people.

783
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:46,371
These inconsistent governing arrangements were a nuisance.

784
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:52,160
Take for example the founding of Britain's 13th American colony in Georgia in 1732.

785
01:19:52,160 --> 01:20:00,338
Initially controlled by a board of trustees, the state had no single governor and no right to an elected assembly.

786
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:11,383
The leader of the trustees, James Ogulthorp, envisioned it as a settler colony for debtors and convicts who could be granted small parcels of land by the trustees.

787
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:17,966
It was also conveniently placed to act as a buffer between South Carolina and Spanish Florida.

788
01:20:17,966 --> 01:20:30,960
Most settlers ended up being regular colonists, not convicts, and for some reason they weren't happy with the prospect of being human shields for Carolina on tiny portions of land with no right to representation.

789
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:37,897
The Georgia colonists complained relentlessly and frequently defied the trustees.

790
01:20:37,897 --> 01:20:43,486
The trustees gave up and handed over the colony to the crown to be its problem instead.

791
01:20:43,486 --> 01:20:47,634
Conflict with native groups was also a persistent problem.

792
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:56,320
In Carolina, war with indigenous peoples, coupled with drought and local unrest raised the possibility of abandoning the territory entirely.

793
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:08,640
The ruling proprietors chose to sell North Carolina back to the crown while keeping South Carolina with its valuable plantations.

794
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:11,240
The South Carolinians dug in and waged their own war against local indigenous groups.

795
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,986
With the support of the Cherokee, the South Carolinians brutally suppressed the Yami

796
01:21:15,986 --> 01:21:21,003
the Creeks, and the Tuscarora, virtually purging Carolina of those groups

797
01:21:21,003 --> 01:21:24,720
but at the cost of about 7% of the white population.

798
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:29,608
The Tuscerora were forced to flee north, where they sought sanctuary with the Irakquay

799
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:33,331
who admitted them as the sixth nation in their confederacy.

800
01:21:33,331 --> 01:21:38,880
Much to the anger of the French and English who knew the Tuscerora had no love for Europeans.

801
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:46,839
Regional problems aside, the picture for the American colonies was still very positive.

802
01:21:46,839 --> 01:21:58,480
The population was growing rapidly from about 210,000 in 1690 to 445,000 in 1720 and 1.2 million by 1750.

803
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:03,440
Most of this growth was natural reproduction rather than immigration.

804
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:12,176
For example, while only 19% of Chesapeake's Bay white population had been born there in 1668

805
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:14,306
it was 90% by 1750.

806
01:22:14,306 --> 01:22:28,676
These growing colonies began spreading inland, too, with the first European settlers heading into Shenondoa Valley and opening the doorways for further westward settlement in the late 18th and early 19th century.

807
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:32,959
Then there were the cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia

808
01:22:32,959 --> 01:22:38,849
which could support even larger populations thanks to the prosperous agriculture around them.

809
01:22:38,849 --> 01:22:44,139
By the mid 18th century, around 10% of Americans were city dwellers

810
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:49,199
a sharp increase from early colonial days and a number that would only keep rising.

811
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,445
Moreover, it was a good life.

812
01:22:53,445 --> 01:22:58,540
The average white American settler could expect to own more lands than a European

813
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:04,649
pay less tax than a European, and have a greater say in government affairs than a European

814
01:23:04,649 --> 01:23:07,987
as long as they were a white male, of course.

815
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:20,560
While European cities were peacemeal evolutions stretching back centuries, American cities were modern constructs often built to a plan and integrated with modern conveniences like pavements

816
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:25,467
libraries, and large ports befitting of a modern trading nation.

817
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:34,252
It is no wonder that many Americans had come to believe that life in the colonies was far superior in many measures than life in Europe.

818
01:23:34,252 --> 01:23:43,159
This was certainly the opinion of Benjamin Franklin, who wrote with pride that every man in New England has a vote in public affairs

819
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:48,141
lives in a tidy, warm house, and has plenty of good food and fuel.

820
01:23:48,141 --> 01:23:54,560
Still, he conceded that the Americans were lacking to their English brethren in matter of manners

821
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,096
etiquette, and virtue.

822
01:23:57,096 --> 01:24:03,735
This however was a problem Franklin did his fair share in addressing through the foundation of newspapers

823
01:24:03,735 --> 01:24:07,760
colleges and philosophical societies in his native Philadelphia.

824
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:17,217
Of course, there were plenty of slaves who would not paint such a rosy picture of American life.

825
01:24:17,217 --> 01:24:25,095
By 1750, there were around 250,000 slaves in the 13 North American colonies

826
01:24:25,095 --> 01:24:29,129
mostly in Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, and Virginia.

827
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:36,712
These slaves experienced harsh legal discrimination with slim prospects of ever buying their freedom.

828
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:48,560
The small free black population was a distant aspiration for the average slave and many of those free blacks secured their status through their own participation in slave exploitation.

829
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:51,685
Slave resistance was common.

830
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:58,875
Attempted escapes, work avoidance, and other small-cale refusal to accept their condition was to be expected

831
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:02,470
but largecale slave revolts were rare.

832
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:08,560
When they did happen, they were usually brief and bloody for everyone involved.

833
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,581
The Stoneo Rebellion of 1739 is a perfect example of this.

834
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:22,639
Several dozen slaves, mostly of Angolan origin, set out from the Stono River in South Carolina in a desperate march towards Spanish Florida

835
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:26,808
where all escaped British slaves were promised amnesty.

836
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:35,811
The escaping slaves killed several dozen whites along the way before being intercepted by slave catchers at the Adisto River.

837
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:38,320
Most of the rebel slaves went down fighting.

838
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:45,416
The most consistently effective slave resistance was found down in the Caribbean

839
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:51,215
especially in Jamaica, where escaped slaves managed to form maroon societies in the interior

840
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:54,596
which resisted British efforts to recapture them.

841
01:25:54,596 --> 01:26:08,080
Between 1728 and 1740, the Jamaican maroons under Captain Kajjo in the west and Nanny in the east managed to successfully fend off British troops until the British were forced to recognize their nominal independence.

842
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:17,128
The British agreed to leave the Maroons alone so long as the Maroons stopped raiding plantations or helping slaves escape.

843
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:23,468
That was great news for the maroons, but meant little to the massive slave population who remained.

844
01:26:23,468 --> 01:26:31,411
By 1763, an estimated 1 in5 people in British controlled America was enslaved.

845
01:26:31,411 --> 01:26:34,935
And that number was at least as high, if not higher

846
01:26:34,935 --> 01:26:37,232
when taking the Americas as a whole.

847
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:44,560
The slaves in the Caribbean colonies were producing over 41,000 tons of sugar by the middle of the century

848
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:54,719
filling the pockets of their colonial masters and leaving nothing for themselves.

849
01:26:51,189 --> 01:26:56,352
With so much valuable trade and so many ambitious European powers

850
01:26:56,352 --> 01:27:02,000
America could prove the sources of conflicts just as much as conditions back in Europe could.

851
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:11,679
For example, in 1731, a Spanish Coast Guard ship in the Caribbean captured the English captain Robert Jenkins and sliced off his ear.

852
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,800
The wounded captain took his pickled ear back to Parliament

853
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:20,764
who eventually seized upon the attack to assemble a fleet to sail against Spanish America.

854
01:27:20,764 --> 01:27:24,843
The War of Jenkins ear did not erupt until 1739

855
01:27:24,843 --> 01:27:31,040
as the year was more of a publicity slogan to mask the real concerns over trade in the Caribbean.

856
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:37,029
Still, this new wave of conflict saw tens of thousands of casualties.

857
01:27:37,029 --> 01:27:42,884
The most significant episode of the war was the British attack on Kardahena in Colombia in 1741.

858
01:27:42,884 --> 01:27:52,720
The British force, composed mostly of American colonists, suffered tremendous casualties in the campaign and lost most of their men to disease or combat.

859
01:27:52,720 --> 01:28:00,916
The War of Jenkins Ear dovetailed into yet another major European conflict in the war of the Austrian secession.

860
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:07,612
Another chaotic inheritance dispute that managed to draw in almost every major European power.

861
01:28:07,612 --> 01:28:11,160
It played out in America as King George's War.

862
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:16,400
Again, colonial troops and native allies were essential to the fighting.

863
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:24,760
It was a force of mostly New England volunteers who won Britain's most important victory at the Battle of Louisbour in 1745

864
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,535
cutting off French access to the St.

865
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:34,945
Lawrence River and indigenous allies made up the backbone of French raids into New York and Massachusetts.

866
01:28:34,945 --> 01:28:43,195
As much as 8% of Massachusetts male population was lost between the War of Jenkins Ear and King George's War.

867
01:28:43,195 --> 01:28:51,183
The war ended with a piece of A/SA Chappella in 1748 with no major territorial changes.

868
01:28:51,183 --> 01:28:58,300
Louise Boore was handed back to France, much to the anger of the American colonists who had fought and died for it.

869
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,080
But what the colonists wanted didn't really matter to Britain

870
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:06,909
who was happy to exchange it for control of the city of Madras over in India.

871
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:10,884
A good deal for the British Empire, but not one for the Americans

872
01:29:10,884 --> 01:29:16,720
who founds that their sacrifices had been betrayed in the name of imperial ambition.

873
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,000
This disconnect between colony and imperial master would only keep growing.

874
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:32,929
The war was a blow for France, who had opens the 18th century with a vast American empire and everything to play for.

875
01:29:32,929 --> 01:29:37,305
New France stretched from Montreal to the mouth of the Mississippi

876
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:41,430
and the French consistently planted new settlements across its breadth

877
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:44,719
from Detroit in 1701 to New Orleans in 1718.

878
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:51,816
While the wars of Spanish and Austrian secession shaped relations with European powers

879
01:29:51,816 --> 01:29:57,069
relations with indigenous peoples proved to be just as important for the French.

880
01:29:57,069 --> 01:30:03,679
The French continued their efforts to ally, incite, remove, or destroy native groups as it saw fit.

881
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:10,800
For example, in 1722, the French missionary Sebastian Rayal, who worked among the Wabanaki of New Hampshire

882
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:14,380
incited them to rebel against British settlers.

883
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:25,340
France was angry about border disputes left over from the peace of Utrect in 1713 and realized that the Wabanaki would make a useful weapon against New England.

884
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:33,600
The conflict raged for 3 years and claimed hundreds of lives.

885
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:36,348
In other places, the French found themselves on the receiving end of native resistance.

886
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:46,544
In November of 1729, for example, French colonists at Fort Rosalie in Mississippi were attacked by the Nachez after years of declining relations.

887
01:30:46,544 --> 01:30:53,339
The Nachez killed all of the men but spares the woman and slaves before burning the settlement to the ground.

888
01:30:53,339 --> 01:31:01,471
Believing a native revolt was imminent, French authorities in New Orleans dispatched soldiers to destroy nearby native villages

889
01:31:01,471 --> 01:31:04,683
even though most had nothing to do with the attack.

890
01:31:04,683 --> 01:31:11,764
The Nachez were eventually scattered with many of them seeking shelter with the Chickasaw in the lower Mississippi Valley.

891
01:31:11,764 --> 01:31:15,774
The French continued to wage war against the Chickasaw, Nachez

892
01:31:15,774 --> 01:31:24,719
and other native groups, many of whom received support from the British while using their own native allies like the Chalkaw well into the 1750s.

893
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:34,269
However, the fates of French colonization in Louisiana would ultimately be decided by events far to the north.

894
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:47,052
On May 28th, 1754, the governor of Virginia dispatched a young officer named George Washington to push away a French garrison from the headarters of the Ohio River.

895
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:54,688
What was supposed to be a simple clearing mission descended into a skirmish which left a dozen men dead.

896
01:31:54,688 --> 01:32:04,135
When word spread of the encounter, both Britain and France escalated their military efforts and began preparing expeditions against each other.

897
01:32:04,135 --> 01:32:10,429
Washington had unintentionally triggered what would later be dubbed the French and Indian War.

898
01:32:10,429 --> 01:32:17,120
When another major European war broke out in 1756 over Austrian territorial claims

899
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:21,293
Britain and France merely continued their conflict.

900
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:27,214
The wider 7 years war pitted Britain, Prussia and Portugal against France

901
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:30,875
Spain, Austria, Russia and Sweden among others.

902
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:38,360
And naturally the war came to the Americans with the European powers and their native allies trading blows.

903
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,920
Initially France got the better of the fighting in North America.

904
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:49,623
The situation was so concerning that in June 1754, representatives from seven American colonies

905
01:32:49,623 --> 01:33:01,893
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire met at Albany to discuss plans for their own defense and possible alliances with the Indians should France invade.

906
01:33:01,893 --> 01:33:11,199
The Albany Congress was the first time that representatives of multiple colonies had gathered together of their own initiative to direct their own affairs.

907
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:16,186
This was no independence meeting, but some of its attendees

908
01:33:16,186 --> 01:33:24,753
like Pennsylvania's Benjamin Franklin, would remember how effective such a model of colonial cooperation was in years to come.

909
01:33:24,753 --> 01:33:30,724
Britain's military fortunes recovered as the war continued through the late 1750s.

910
01:33:30,724 --> 01:33:35,822
In 1759, they went on the offensive, sailing an army up the St.

911
01:33:35,822 --> 01:33:41,246
Lawrence River and laying siege to Quebec City, which fell in September that year.

912
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:47,067
In 1760, they marched west and rested control of Montreal from France as well.

913
01:33:47,067 --> 01:33:52,639
Britain's gains in Canada and events back in Europe secured its victory in the war by 1763.

914
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:59,040
The resulting treaty of Paris was the deathnell for France's American Empire.

915
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:06,736
Britain would keep all of France's old Canadian territory and its 100,000 inhabitants.

916
01:34:06,736 --> 01:34:09,609
Meanwhile, French Louisiana was split.

917
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:14,080
Everything west of the Mississippi went to Spain, while everything east went to Britain

918
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:17,040
including Spanish Florida.

919
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,476
Aside from a handful of small islands, France's American Empire

920
01:34:22,476 --> 01:34:23,320
was over.

921
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:31,199
However, Britain would not have too long to celebrate this victory before it too faced colonial collapse.

922
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:39,600
Britain's victory in the 7 Years War was expensive in both money and manpower.

923
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:52,396
War debt sat at 161 million pounds and much of the fighting in America had been done by American colonists who felt unappreciated by the crown.

924
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:58,823
Britain also now faced the cost and challenge of managing an expanded American empire.

925
01:34:58,823 --> 01:35:03,198
As well as dealing with an unhappily occupied French population

926
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,996
many would be deported from Acadia to Louisiana where they became the Cinjun.

927
01:35:07,996 --> 01:35:12,508
Britain also had to deal with a new waves of native resistance.

928
01:35:12,508 --> 01:35:19,802
conflict with the Cherokee in Carolina in the 1760s and the Great Northern Indian uprising in 1763

929
01:35:19,802 --> 01:35:25,760
which saw a coalition of native groups come together to oppose Britain's new dominance

930
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,000
proved that Britain was still in desperate need of money and manpower to secure its empire.

931
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:39,378
King George III felt that the American colonies should pay their fair share for this.

932
01:35:39,378 --> 01:35:49,291
The Sugar Act of 1764 marked the first of a series of taxes and duties imposed upon the American colonists to meet this goal.

933
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:54,810
However, Britain had underestimated the confidence and resistance of the colonies.

934
01:35:54,810 --> 01:36:03,848
The imposition of even a relatively small tax against their wishes triggered unexpectedly intense resistance from the colonists.

935
01:36:03,848 --> 01:36:10,000
They objected to the taxes being imposed upon them by parliament which they had no representation in.

936
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:21,360
Britain ignored the initial objections and pressed on with the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townzang duties of 1767 imposed upon a variety of goods.

937
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:26,533
Altogether, the new taxes weren't actually all that much.

938
01:36:26,533 --> 01:36:35,646
The typical American colonist was still taxed less and experienced less government control than virtually anyone in Europe at that time.

939
01:36:35,646 --> 01:36:39,865
However, a fiercely independent colonial spirit had emerged.

940
01:36:39,865 --> 01:36:49,679
Wealthy, stable, and confident, many of the colonists felt that they had surpassed Britain and resented the mother country imposing anything on them.

941
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:56,014
Protests mounted and Britain was forced to send troops into American cities to keep order.

942
01:36:56,014 --> 01:37:05,127
On March 5th, 1770, this decision turns to tragedy in Boston when British troops opened fire on unarmed protesters

943
01:37:05,127 --> 01:37:06,400
killing five people.

944
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:10,382
Discontent was now turning to anger.

945
01:37:10,382 --> 01:37:19,723
The Tea Act of 1773 was designed to limit the trade of smuggled tea and boost revenue for the struggling East India Company.

946
01:37:19,723 --> 01:37:29,783
Instead, it convinced anti-British leaders in Boston to march aboard company ships and dump 10,000 lbs of tea into Boston Harbor.

947
01:37:29,783 --> 01:37:34,100
In response, Britain closed down all the ports.

948
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:41,151
This had the obvious effect of angering anyone dependent upon trade and fueled anti-British feeling.

949
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:47,049
By now, assemblies and elites across the colony were urging support for Boston

950
01:37:47,049 --> 01:37:50,133
and calls for full-blown revolt were mounting.

951
01:37:50,133 --> 01:38:04,354
By 1774, a Continental Congress modeled after the Albany Conference of 1754 brought 12 of the 13 American colonies together to demand a boycott of all British goods.

952
01:38:04,354 --> 01:38:12,383
The imposition of more strict laws curtailing colonial freedom, known to the Americans as the intolerable acts

953
01:38:12,383 --> 01:38:14,020
was the breaking point.

954
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:20,677
Negotiation and peaceful protest had failed, and the militias were America's only alternative.

955
01:38:20,677 --> 01:38:27,679
In April 1775, British troops met American rebels at the battles of Lexington and Concord.

956
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:32,928
The first engagement of the Revolutionary War went in favor of the British

957
01:38:32,928 --> 01:38:35,596
as did the second at Bunker Hill in June.

958
01:38:35,596 --> 01:38:40,879
But Britain's victories only seems to unify the colonists against it.

959
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:45,463
The Americans tried and failed to incite Canada to join the rebellion

960
01:38:45,463 --> 01:38:50,000
losing 500 men to a disastrous Quebec expedition in December of 1775.

961
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:56,160
But that did not deter the rest of the American colonies.

962
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:03,147
On July 4th, 1776, the Continental Congress issued their Declaration of Independence

963
01:39:03,147 --> 01:39:06,614
ushering in a new age of American history.

964
01:39:06,614 --> 01:39:13,241
It would take until 1783 for the United States to secure this independence through force of arms.

965
01:39:13,241 --> 01:39:18,639
But it would look back at 1776 as the moment the country was born.

966
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:29,988
By 1776, the colonization of the Americas had resulted in the birth of a new nation that would go on to shape world history.

967
01:39:29,988 --> 01:39:36,960
The independence of the United States foreshadowed the collapse of most European colonial powers.

968
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:48,709
Over the next few decades, most of the rest of the Americas would throw off European colonial rule and usher in a new age of American independence.

969
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:53,855
Between 1492 and 1776, the Americas changed.

970
01:39:53,855 --> 01:39:57,036
More conflict and struggles emerged.

971
01:39:57,036 --> 01:39:59,104
Maps were redrawn.

972
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,735
New cities rose.

973
01:40:00,735 --> 01:40:04,998
And slowly, new identities began to take shape.

974
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:10,159
Huge networks of trade, culture, and power stretched across oceans.

975
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:15,899
European empires expanded while Native American tribes shrunk.

976
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:22,273
At the end of the 18th century, the Americas were no longer a mystery to Europe

977
01:40:22,273 --> 01:40:27,119
but a land they claimed, fought, and competed over.

978
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:32,719
And the way it happened set the stage for new beginnings.

979
